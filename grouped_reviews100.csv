An urban nightmare with a surfeit of soul, ""Precious: Based on the Novel 'Push' by Sapphire"" is like a diamond -- clear, bright, but oh so hard. An overwhelming, masterful dramatic competition entrant, this Lee Daniels film may have no bounds in the awards categories. Boasting strong performances and lightened by a few flashes of much-needed easy humour, Precious is let down by Daniels' ropey direction - which leaves you feeling like it could/should have been a much better film. Boasting strong performances and lightened by a few flashes of much-needed easy humour, Precious is let down by Daniels' ropey direction - which leaves you feeling like it could/should have been a much better film. Raw, moving and somewhat akin to having a piano dropped on your head, Precious is a fable of abuse and redemption. Raw, moving and somewhat akin to having a piano dropped on your head, Precious is a fable of abuse and redemption. It's a once-in-a-blue-moon experience that tests the boundaries of film, with an electrifying, positively Oscar-worthy performance by salty stand-up comic Mo'Nique, as the most monstrous mother on the planet.

While the director, Lee Daniels, does not shy away from the grimmest elements of the story, his eclectic filmmaking style is almost exhilarating, finding room for fantasy, operatic melodrama, and authentic humor. What rescues Precious is the performance of Mo'Nique as Mary, the heroine's Medusa-like mother. Daniels does everything to hold the melodrama at bay, but there's only so much he can do.

Precious captures how a lost girl rouses herself from the dead, and Daniels shows unflinching courage as a filmmaker by going this deep into the pathologies that may still linger in the closets of some impoverished inner-city lives. Given the months-long hype, what's most bewildering about Sundance sensation Precious is its overall shrug-worthiness. Precious captures how a lost girl rouses herself from the dead, and Daniels shows unflinching courage as a filmmaker by going this deep into the pathologies that may still linger in the closets of some impoverished inner-city lives. Given the months-long hype, what's most bewildering about Sundance sensation Precious is its overall shrug-worthiness. This is an exceptional film about nearly unendurable circumstances, endured. You will come out the other side of it a markedly enriched filmgoer. This is a fine movie, and a deep one. It's about unearthing buried treasure. In offering up their heroine's misery for the audience's delectation, they've created something uncomfortably close to poverty porn. Daniels may be indulging in stunt casting, and slamming plot points home with sledgehammer subtlety, but the film's milieu and characters feel alarmingly real. And its story ends up packing an emotional wallop. The whole thing begins to feel like The Color Purple as rewritten for a poetry slam, heaping on the abuse like a horror film. Precious punishes the audience with scene after scene of squalor and hopelessness, but like last year's poverty-can-be-entertaining hit Slumdog Millionaire, it rewards them for hanging on 'til the end. There are pitfalls inherent in this kind of story, but indie director Lee Daniels sidesteps them, crafting a feature that is both emotionally honest and stirring. The film is a tribute to Sidibe's ability to engage our empathy. Her work is still another demonstration of the mystery of some actors, who evoke feelings in ways beyond words and techniques.

One that you hope will not be dismissed as too difficult, because it should not be missed. The girl's story is almost unbearably painful, and when Precious finally reclaims her dignity and self-worth, her accomplishment seems genuinely heroic. This remarkable, first-time actress makes Clareece truly precious, a full-fledged member of the human tribe. Believe the hype. A hybrid, a mash-up that might have been ungainly, but that manages to be graceful instead. Daniels is not a subtle director, and he encourages Mo'Nique's powerful expansiveness. But it's much harder to act quietly than loudly, as Sidibe must do, and her still grace should not be mistaken for blankness.

The real star of this show is director Lee Daniels. He's the one who conjures the film's eerie mix of kitchen-sink realism and gothic symbolism, its deft back-and-forth between the horrific and the sublime. [I]f Precious has a crucial flaw, it is that it is at once too bleak and too hopeful in its closing scenes: too bleak in the history it unearths, and too hopeful that the mere fact of the unearthing will make that history go away.

Director Lee Daniels takes us on a journey -- letting us look down our noses at this misshapen lump of a girl with contempt and pity.

But Sidibe plays shadings of strength underneath that eventually win our grudging respect. No, Precious is not an easy sit, and isn't meant to be. But it's a film of remarkable strength and poignancy, filled with vivid performances that stay with you long after you've left the theater. You can feel Daniels struggling to trust his mighty goddesses to carry the film. (He wedges in shots of boiling pigs feet to make sure we're queasy.) Precious stacks the deck so high against its protagonist that in almost any other movie, she would come off as a helpless victim. No, Precious is not an easy sit, and isn't meant to be.

If you do watch -- and you certainly should -- you will see one of the most remarkable performances ever set to film, given by Gabourey ""Gabby"" Sidibe. It melodramatizes everything and yet its overall effect is something more than melodrama. Mo'Nique plunges headfirst into a moral abyss that makes her frightening. The picture painted by director Lee Daniels is almost unbearably bleak, but it feels completely honest. It's indeed relentless, but also transfixing and ultimately transformative.

Avoiding the conventional tricks of lifting an audience up, the movie looks into this girl's wide, brown face and her bleak little life and sees, despite everything, a reason to live. A film full of life and love, well-meaning and, judging by the reaction in the US, a genuine and important phenomenon that says act - don't dwell - on your dreams. Precious is a big-screen ""misery memoir"" that is so keen to trace the hellish pathology of familial abuse that it risks glorifying its own subject, or at least shooting it with horror-movie verve. It isn't the transcendent masterpiece that some admirers would have you believe: more like a black-comic nightmare that isn't exactly supposed to be funny. It's certainly arresting, though. It's enough to make you cry. Equally, it might make you laugh. Daniels is a director who would find it hard to imagine puddings can be over-egged, or that Monty Python's 'We're So Poor' sketch was meant to be funny. Employing a suitably chiaroscuro film language to balance the emotional extremes of the subject matter, his vision is a lively composite of urban nightmare and garish escapism. What is surprising about the film is the harshness with which her adverse conditions are depicted, and the tentativeness of her recovery. So staggering, in fact, are the offences to decency, loyalty and love that you begin to worry that the film will topple over from the weight of its woes. If the director sometimes takes a sledgehammer to crack a nut, then all will be forgiven as you watch the story of Precious unfold.

Prisoners is a dog whistle for Academy voters keyed to a pitch that screams, ""For the love of God, nominate me for something!"" This is a powerful, engrossing film that transcends the normal constraints of its genre and is worth your investment of both time and attention. Prepare to be electrified! When it comes to thrillers, Prisoners is the must-see sensation of the year. In addition to the skin-crawling camera moves and the understated dread that bolsters the surface tensions of ""Prisoners"" there is a fascinating actor's duel going on. A film that seems headed toward one conclusion, then veers toward another over 2/₂ of the fastest-moving hours I've seen in a recent movie. Grim, gray and surprisingly gruesome, Prisoners - the director's first foray into English-language filmmaking - has its flaws, but predictability is not one of them. The plot raises complicated moral questions about how far an anguished person will go for the love of a child. At the same time, it sets up an intricate, horrifying mystery with breathtaking skill. ""Prisoners"" is a dark, deeply serious examination of how loss can unhinge us; it grabs onto you, and you may have trouble shaking it away. A gorgeous but manipulative thriller that wants you to ponder Big Questions as it sends a shiver down your spine. A work of impressive craftsmanship that winds up making us think too much about how it was fashioned rather than what it has to say. The screenplay is smart, the execution is impeccable, and the holes are few and far between. One of the most intense thrillers in recent years. Best performance of Hugh Jackman's career. As gripping as it is grueling, with performances that swing for the fences and a knotty central mystery. A frustrating puzzle in which the pieces don't quite fit together Even when audiences start to question the logical leaps, the performances and visuals remain first-rate. The movie doesn't feel bloated. And the final scenes are anything but a cop-out. It's easy to make a thriller. It's hard to make one that says something about human nature and then, like the hauntingly compelling ""Prisoners,"" finds something inside the genre that validates tying your nerves up in knots. It absorbs and controls your attention with such assurance that you hold your breath for fear of distracting the people on screen, exhaling in relief or amazement at each new revelation. A devastating psychological thriller, Prisoners pulls us deep into our worst fear: the Amber Alert. Then it holds us under. A grade-A genre exercise - but it's a genre predicated on specious reasoning and promiscuous, pseudo-sacrificial suffering. Director Denis Villeneuve's work with the exemplary actors results in a film of startling impact, packed with twists you don't see coming. You can't shake it. Throughout this beautifully made, slightly specious exercise in Old Testament revenge, the character-study aspects of ""Prisoners"" coexist intriguingly with the grisly-inhumanity components. Hugh Jackman gives the performance of his career as a father seeking two kidnapped girls in Denis Villeneuve's taut thriller. Though it's nothing you haven't seen before, it's so artfully made and skillfully executed that you won't care a bit. It's preposterous schlock masquerading as art. Prisoners uncoils with a serpent's stealth - and strikes just as suddenly. [An] exquisitely calibrated thriller. ""Prisoners"" is, above all, an effective thriller, but it wants you to take it more seriously than that. There's no deal-breaking reason not to. While the movie is certainly less than the sum of its referents, it nonetheless works as a formally controlled genre piece.

While the movie is certainly less than the sum of its referents, it nonetheless works as a formally controlled genre piece. Ethical exploration or exploitation? In the end, I come down reservedly on the former side: the work done here by Jackman, Gyllenhaal, and especially Villeneuve is simply too powerful to ignore. Prisoners is unforgettably relentless in asking moviegoers if Keller has gone too far. And, by extension, asking us how far we would go. A film that, for all its pretensions and intermittent power, is essentially high-grade claptrap. Prisoners is an overblown missing-children mystery that wants to comment on the dysfunctional soul of America. Prisoners has got more pedigree than a Westminster dog-show winner. It's just not very good. In fact, it's worse than not-very-good; it's could've-been-really-good-and-isn't. Aspects of ""Prisoners"" are effective, but for the most part it's rather ridiculous (despite the fact that it clearly wants to be taken super-seriously), and there's an overwrought quality to much of the acting. The film you begin watching when the lights dim is not the same one you carry home from the theatre. After two hours of relentless tension, Prisoners starts revealing its secrets to progressively hokier effect. Is it the best Hollywood mystery we've seen in awhile? Oh yes. Is it one any parent would want to see? Only if they don't mind nightmares. It never lets up. The cell doors never open. Ethical exploration or exploitation?

Prometheus elicits Alien memories for viewers who have them, but works on its own, too, as a model of a contemporary (and, as is the contempo mode, long-winded) sci-fi horror pic. ""Prometheus"" repeats many past glories, and its plot is squishy nonsense. But its grand sets and intricate effects are dazzling, and in at least one scene, Scott almost manages to top himself. You're more likely to enjoy the film if you go in thinking less about ""Alien"" and more about Scott, with his emphasis on images, tone and atmosphere over -- sometimes at the expense of -- plot and story. Why are we here? What is our purpose? Is there a God? When does this movie get good? Like ""Alien,"" the new movie derives its appeal not only from stunning, otherworldly imagery but also from the central performances tasked with reacting to it. This is a remarkably scary and eye-popping headrush of a movie, an experience that offers a maximum adrenaline boost at the same time as it engages your intelligence. Don't miss it.

Prometheus is more interested in piling on big questions than in answering them. It's deep without being particularly smart, although the dazzling design and special effects keep you from noticing that basic flaw until at least an hour in. When it comes to technical wizardry and sheer visual spectacle, Prometheus unequivocally delivers. If you have fond, 33-year-old memories of averting your young eyes from a propulsive parasite critter, Prometheus might just be your kind of return trip. What resonates in Scott's graceful, grownup, pristine film is its majestic mind. This tale of an interstellar search asks cosmic questions about the meaning of life, but comes up with lame answers in a script that screams attention-deficit disorder. The ending isn't squishy scary or deeply satisfying. Bummer. Otherwise, Prometheus kicks ass so hard and often that it's impossible not to be thrilled by it. Unlike any of the sequels between it and the original, Prometheus is a horror movie first and foremost, gnawing at subconscious terrors even as your conscious mind attempts to bat it away. Narratively, it's a mess. There's a through-line Darwinism vs. creationism thing going on that ping-pongs big religious and philosophical ideas, but whiffs the return. I saw Prometheus without my trusty guide-wife next to me to describe the creepy stuff yet watched every second of the movie. And not once did I jump out of my skin. Making up for the expected nature of some of the film's plot twists is Arthur Max's spooky, H.R. Giger-influenced production design, Dariusz Wolski's fluid cinematography, as well as Scott's moment-to-moment storytelling skill. The plot of this Alien prequel was a carefully guarded secret -- so carefully guarded, in fact, that not even the movie reveals it. God (or Alien) knows this movie is derivative. But as someone else once said, originality isn't everything. Prometheus is a prequel that works as a stand-alone but offers added benefits to those familiar with the Alien series. Stripped to its visceral essentials, the franchise is meant to frighten us and gross us out, and Prometheus rises to that modest challenge. Aping Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" Scott and his screenwriters have designed this towering puzzle to provoke debate, with liberal allusions to gender, race and religion. An impressive epic about the extraordinary vastness of the universe, and the immense puniness of us. Mr. Scott's sense of visual scale, which has often produced hectic, hectoring grandiosity (are you not entertained?), achieves, especially in the first hour, something like genuine grandeur. While its vast sets and production values are simply stunning, ""Prometheus"" ultimately disappoints. Though Prometheus follows Alien's story beats, it's a looser and less satisfying story, more intellectual than visceral, and not fully satisfying on either level. But in part, that's because it's trying to do so much more. Ridley Scott's ""Prometheus"" is a magnificent science-fiction film, all the more intriguing because it raises questions about the origin of human life and doesn't have the answers.

The setup is familiar-the mysterious planet, the slick tunnels, the shocking bodily violation, the broken quarantine, etc. So why is there a gaping hole where the dread should be? Prometheus tells a much bigger story and does it well, but it's missing what matters most. It's inorganic. There's definite mastery here, but it's hardly a masterpiece. Prometheus--like, in its telling, the human race itself--is a creation spliced from the DNA of superior forebears. Much like Rutger Hauer's turn as a replicant in Scott's Blade Runner, Fassbender's performance may launch Prometheus into the cult stratosphere. I'll say this much for it -- it's not boring. Ridley Scott means to bring wonder and horror back to summertime spectacle, and Prometheus mostly succeeds in that regard. (Mostly.) ""Prometheus"" has the integrity of a serious and sincere attempt, but ultimately it won't please anybody. With its creepy caves and yawning space, ""Prometheus"" is on one level a somber dialogue between man the aspirant and man the mortal. ""Prometheus"" is genuinely epic.

If nothing else, there's no need to worry about where Quantum of Solace fits in the Bond pantheon -- it's easily one of the worst. Quantum is content merely to be the second episode in what's shaping up to be a viable series, good enough but disappointing for those expecting greatness. Forster is elbowing us to agree that the franchise in his reins is just another spectacle. Not every director is well-suited to Bondland. ""There's something horribly efficient about you,"" Kurylenko says to Craig at one point. The same goes for the film. Quantum of Solace isn't frivolous or cheesy, but it isn't all that much fun either. Craig is still the right guy for the job, but for his boiling-on-the-inside performance to work, he needs more to play with. Forster is indeed a fine director, but he's hardly a specialist in action films, and it shows. He can't quite keep things moving fast enough to speed past the absurdity of the premise. There isn't much plot between the action set pieces, and precious little character development beyond Craig's and Dench's continuing evolution. Quantum of Solace benefits from imaginatively conceived action sequences and from a director, Marc Forster, who knows how to film them. The action and eye candy may be worth the ticket price, but this Bond needs to get back to business. The result isn't bland, but it's not exactly Bond either. All dressed up with no particular place to go, this 22nd Bond film tries hard but ends up an underachiever. A few years back, the easy sexism and narcissism of the James Bond series looked dated to the point of obsolescence, but Quantum of Solace proves that a revenge motive is just what's needed to rejuvenate all the Bond cliches. I repeat: James Bond is not an action hero! Leave the action to your Jason Bournes. This is a swampy old world. The deeper we sink in, the more we need James Bond to stand above it. The stunts are as muscular and the film as handsome to look at as the hero who so ably pulls them off. But the story linking it all together is thin and weak. Marc Forster seems like a counterintuitive choice to direct an action spectacle. But any doubts I might have had flew out the window and splattered onto the hood of a parked car during an early, hellacious brawl. A silly spy may be laughable, but a sulking thug is just a bore.

Quantum of Solace prompts the question: Is revenge the only possible motive for large-scale movie heroism these days? Quantum of Solace is a model of mediocrity, even though Daniel Craig gives his all to a production that doesn't deserve him. The Quantum of Solace filmmakers have produced a super-serious, often visually incoherent travelogue of revenge and trumped-up angst. Forster, a director of upscale tearjerkers, has no feel for action sequences. The big chases, of which there are several, could all be replaced with a title card reading, 'Insert action here'. Quantum of Solace is best when director Marc Forster allows his star the latitude to explore emotions that, until Craig stepped into the shoes of the character, we didn't know Bond had. This is the least satisfying production since The Living Daylights. Quantum -- the 22d 'official' Bond picture, 24th including the rogue Bonds -- is never less than engaging. In the end it's all too fast and too furious -- and far too obsessed with exercising its license to thrill. Revenge is a dish best served with bullets, high explosives and giant rolling flameballs. In Quantum of Solace, James Bond orders the revenge buffet, deluxe. Quantum of Solace never really engages you in the mechanical but transporting way the best Bond movies do. If you held up your thumb over Daniel Craig's face and took in the mayhem around him, you'd think you were watching The Bourne Simulation rather than the 22nd (and shortest-ever) ode to Ian Fleming's suave government killer. With [this] too-shaken sequel, the Bond market experiences a dip. Mr. White ultimately leads Bond to one Mr. Slate, who in turn leads him to a Mr. Greene. That's right: The global conspiracy this time around isn't SPECTRE, but some rogue wing of the United Colors of Benetton. The problems can be traced to a screenplay that is stuffed with internecine plot points and shades-of-gray complexities, but little else: no character-sharpening details and none of the wit and charm that buoyed Casino Royale. Frankly, Quantum of Solace is just one exasperated dressing down away from being Lethal Weapon 9.

Eventually, the movie, as with other similarly humane and perceptive comedies, allows its audience to see that not only does everyone have his or her reasons for behaving as they do, those reasons may be far less easy to dismiss as one supposes. The Queen is an interesting character study. There's not much plot to speak of, but it gives actors (including a splendid Helen Mirren) an opportunity to shine. Marvelously smart, funny and entertaining. A crackling dramatic story that's intelligent, thoughtful and moving. Mirren's finely calibrated performance reveals a complex woman coping with a bewildering world, and Blair's growing sympathy for his beleaguered monarch gradually becomes ours. A fascinating character study and a brilliantly crafted drama. It has some of the wittiest writing in recent memory and spot-on performances.

Frears has given us a front-row seat for a backstage drama; the result is provocatively realistic.

Though Rabbit Hole tells a familiar tale, its goofy, loving feel for human cruelty and rage, for kindness and breakthrough bursts of exuberance, lifts this lovely chamber piece high above the crowd. All that emotion never quite manages to inspire the deep, resonant empathy these stricken parents -- and, more to the point, we in the audience -- so desperately need. Rabbit Hole is a finely tuned portrait of grief that takes its time unfolding, much like the actual process of mourning.

[Kidman's] beautiful performance transcends the specifics of the script, which David Lindsay-Abaire adapted from his play of the same name. The piece as a whole feels earnest and well-meaning but rarely compelling, a film that is almost too decorous to be as involving as it should be.

Eschewing clichs, Rabbit Hole is disturbing yet refreshing evidence that for some people, redemption takes longer, and for others, the pain never goes away at all.

Rachel Getting Married, [Demme's] newest feature, is a return to the low-budget, low-stress roots of Citizens Band and Melvin and Howard. With Rachel Getting Married, Demme has once again scaled back, making a picture that has some of the ease and warmth of his earlier movies. All this music and movement lends the movie a shaggy, Altman-esque texture, a sense that its scope is wider than any one character's story.

Rachel Getting Married has the sense to recognize that it only takes one lunatic to throw a family gathering out of kilter; this is not an exercise in competitive crazy like last year's irritating Margot at the Wedding. The film is Demme-esque, harking back to the darkness and emotional complexity of The Silence of the Lambs and the madcap energy of Something Wild. Rachel Getting Married is a portrait of a family reeling with pain and resentment -- and rising to the challenge of dealing with it head-on.

No doubt it was fun assembling so many close associates, but like Kym, Demme doesn't know when enough is enough for those who aren't part of the family circle. The question before us is: When exactly did Jonathan Demme lose his sense of humor? Hathaway, DeWitt, Irwin and especially Winger are working at a very high level. So is their director. His intuition regarding how to film this particular milestone event, and the stories unfolding in the margins, turned out to be just right. Rachel Getting Married is at its best in scenes featuring Hathaway's mercurial character. It's a triumphant and darkly nuanced role for her and a departure from the more lighthearted comedic performances she has given. A minor work, but so menaced by distress that the characters take every opportunity to dance the dark away. A filmmaker for nearly 35 years, [Demme] has both the experience and the temperament to be a hang-loose perfectionist with this kind of off-the-cuff yet pointed material.

I found these heart-on-sleeve sequences really charming and open, and the people in them looked like real human beings and not actors - overemotional, perhaps, but overemotional in the way real people are at real weddings. It's not Demme's most polished film, granted - but dysfunction is all the more piercing when you don't put a gloss on it. You'll be very glad you were invited because this is a friendly, unpretentious bash, with not a meringue dress in sight. The speeches are funny, the music is ace and the mood falls just the right side of sentimental mushiness. The film, like the shindig, ends up dissolving in a schmaltzy brew of make-do-and-mend, complete with a sari-clad wedding accompanied by multi-ethnic music, whose PC touchy-feeliness one hopes is a joke but fears is not. It's Altman-esque, in good and bad ways, though by the end I confess I felt like the traditional mother of the bride, my eyes filling up helplessly even as I begged, ""no more"". Director Jonathan Demme, who says he wanted to make ""the most beautiful home movie ever made"", didn't rehearse scenes before filming. He and Hathaway, as much as Lumet, deserve praise for creating a pariah at once close-to-home and unique.

The master chefs at Pixar have blended all the right ingredients -- abundant verbal and visual wit, genius slapstick timing, a soupcon of Gallic sophistication -- to produce a warm and irresistible concoction. Brad Bird and Pixar Animation Studios are proving to be an unbeatable combination. Brad Bird and Pixar Animation Studios are proving to be an unbeatable combination.

Ratatouille has the Pixar technical magic without, somehow, the full Pixar flavor. It's Brad Bird's genial dessert, not so much incredible as merely sweetly edible. Brad Bird wrote and directed Ratatouille and tops his previous work. Since his work includes The Iron Giant and The Incredibles, this puts him somewhere between Chuck Jones and Michelangelo. Brad Bird wrote and directed Ratatouille and tops his previous work. Since his work includes The Iron Giant and The Incredibles, this puts him somewhere between Chuck Jones and Michelangelo. Ratatouille is free of the kind of gratuitous pop-culture references that plague so many movies of the genre; it tells a story, it's very much of our world but it never goes for the cheap, easy gag. For parents looking to spend time in a theater with their kids or adults who want something lighter and less testosterone-oriented than the usual summer fare, Ratatouille offers a savory main course. What makes Ratatouille such a hilarious and heartfelt wonder is the way Bird contrives to let it sneak up on you. And get a load of that score from Michael Giacchino, a perfect compliment to a delicious meal.

What makes Ratatouille such a hilarious and heartfelt wonder is the way Bird contrives to let it sneak up on you. And get a load of that score from Michael Giacchino, a perfect compliment to a delicious meal. Ratatouille is delicious fun sure to be savored by audiences of all ages for its sumptuous visuals, clever wit and irresistibly inspiring tale. Like the burbling soup that plays a key part in Ratatouille, the movie is a delectable blend of ingredients that tickles the palette and leaves you hungry for more. Brad Bird's Ratatouille is so audacious you have to fall in love with its unlikely hero. Ratatouille is Brad Bird's best movie yet, and from the writer-director who made two of the best American animated features of the past decade, The Incredibles and the sadly neglected Iron Giant, that's something. The characters are irresistible, the animation is astonishing and the film, a fantasy version of a foodie rhapsody, sustains a level of joyous invention that hasn't been seen in family entertainment since The Incredibles. With Ratatouille, Bird once again delivers not just a great, witty story, but dazzling visuals as well. In sequence after sequence, we are presented with visual set pieces that far exceed the imaginativeness of most live-action dramatic fare. Bird has a rare cinematic gift: the ability to stage slam-bang action sequences without neglecting the rich emotional resonance that makes for a great story. So many computer-animated movies are brash, loud and popping with pop-culture comedy, but Ratatouille has the warm glow of a favorite book. The characters are more than the sum of their gigabyte-consuming parts -- they feel handcrafted. The film may be animated, and largely taken up with rats, but its pulse is gratifyingly human. And you have never seen a computer-animated feature with this sort of visual panache and detail. A test for tiny tots, a mite nostalgic and as male-dominated as a modern kitchen it may be, but these are mere quibbles about this delightful addition to the Pixar pantheon.

Ratatouille doesn't center on the over-familiar surfaces of contemporary life. It harks back to Disney's older era, when cartoons seemed part of a more elegant world with less edgy characters. Had Bird gone the safe route, he would have robbed us of a great new cartoon figure in Remy, who like the rest of the film is rendered with animation that is at once fanciful and life-like. It's also my pick for Pixar's best. From the moment Remy enters, crashing, to the final happy fadeout, Ratatouille parades the brio and depth that set Pixar apart from and above other animation studios. How good, and how much fun, is Ratatouille? So good that when it was over, all I wanted to do was watch it again. This is an animated movie that's been made for adults, although kids probably will enjoy it, too. Ratatouille never overwhelms, even though it's stocked with action, romance, historical content, family drama and serious statements about the creation of art. A film as rich as a sauce béarnaise, as refreshing as a raspberry sorbet, and a lot less predictable than the damn food metaphors and adjectives all us critics will churn out to describe it. OK, one more and then I'll be done: it's yummy. Fresh family fun. Although there are those slightly noxious images of rodents scampering around a kitchen, the movie doesn't stoop to kid-pandering jokes based on back talk and bodily gases. Displaying the usual meticulousness associated with the Pixar brand, Ratatouille is a nearly flawless piece of popular art. Arguably the finest 'toon in the Pixar canon. The Pixar magic continues with Brad Bird's Ratatouille, a gorgeous, wonderfully inventive computer-animated comedy. Ratatouille is the most straightforward and formulaic picture to date from Pixar Animation Studios, but it is also among the most enchanting and touching. No sketchy backgrounds here -- Ratatouille's scenes feels like deep-focus camera shots. The textures, from the gleam of copper pans to the cobblestone streets, are almost palpable. Ratatouille has the technical genius, emotional core and storytelling audacity to lift it into the ranks of [the best] Pixar films, the crème de la crème of modern animation. Ratatouille has its heart, and its head, in this effort to serve up something unique and satisfying. Writer and director Brad Bird keeps Ratatouille moving without resorting to the cute animal jokes or pop-culture wisecracking that ruined so many other recent animated films. Pixar, the undisputed heavyweight champion of the animation world, retains the title with this winning tale. Ratatouille will make you wonder why animation needs to hide behind the mantle of 'it's for children, but grownups will like it, too.' This one's for Mom and Dad, and yep, the kids will like it, too. Brad Bird's second collaboration with Pixar is more ambitious and meditative than his Oscar-winning The Incredibles. The movie doesn't have to strain for liftoff the way Pixar's Cars did (that movie had a Volvo's boxiness). Ratatouille keeps inventing surprises.

The whole film, in fact, with its loping pace and plaintive score, feels like a woefully polite, not to say British, take on a foreign horror; was there really no one, from the fierce new wave of German filmmakers, prepared to dramatize the Schlink?

The Reader comes off as a movie that doggedly follows some dull, preordained text. It's Winslet who dares to read between the lines. Thankfully, Kate Winslet bares not just her body but her soul with a performance that pierces the genteel polish of this high-minded awards-season drama.

The movie adaptation by screenwriter David Hare and director Stephen Daldry starts out choppy and overdrawn but develops a cumulative power. The Reader remains schematic, and ultimately reductive.

The Reader, distant though it can be, touches and provokes a mulling over of the Holocaust like few films on the subject in recent memory. With this film Daldry proves himself the screen's reigning master at showing passion thwarted or repressed, this time to a propulsive Philip Glass-lite score from Nico Muhly. At times The Reader is an interesting exploration of both the needs of man and the limits of law. But there are so many dead spots in the film after it gets rolling that the rolling too often comes to a stop. I believe the movie may be demonstrating a fact of human nature: Most people, most of the time, all over the world, choose to go along. We vote with the tribe. After a sensuous introductory act, The Reader descends into a series of dismaying contradictions regarding the moral toxins of the Holocaust -- which still pollute postwar Germany. Winslet is outstanding, particularly given that Hanna is such an unsympathetic character. We never quite feel sympathy toward her, and it's testament to Winslet's skill and confidence that she never really asks us to. Told, coolly...the novel was hugely popular as well as controversial worldwide and an Oprah's Book Club selection besides.

The still, sad music of humanity - surely that should have been The Reader's score.

It is made with his customary fluency and shows an offbeat humour you wouldn't normally associate with him. ... a bumper pack of cinematic Viagra for a film that surges forward improbably for the first wildly propulsive hour, before inevitably collapsing into a flaccid heap, long before its epic, overlong running time is done.

It's dazzling stuff.

Despite some sensory overload, there's no denying Steven Spielberg is a master at crafting mind-blowing action sequences. Might as well jump to it. Again and again, the movie's setting - and Spielberg's practiced craftsmanship - help turn some of its manifold potential bugs into features. Might mark the beginning of a new era in filmmaking or the end of an old one, but either way it feels like a failed experiment in building a new story on the carcasses of old movies, TV shows and video games. It's good to see Spielberg, at 71, still finding new forms of cinematic language with which to express his humanism. Spielberg deftly switches between the blinking, bleeping world of the OASIS and the grayer, grittier reality outside. Meanwhile, there's a touch of innocence that never lets us forget this dazzling spectacle is still basically a fairy tale. So how does it all come together? Pretty marvellously from a visual point of view, maybe less so from one a narrative one. At its best, Ready Player One unfolds like unstructured free time for Hollywood's biggest kid, unleashed in a playground he helped construct, one Amblin entertainment at a time. It is without a question one of the year's most energetic, visually rewarding, and ultimately exhausting motion pictures. If Ready Player One had been directed by a 26-year-old, the movie world would be flipping out over the new visionary on the map. For those who get their fix through pop nostalgia, ""Ready Player One"" is - for better or worse - an indulgent, dizzying overdose. Steven Spielberg's sci-fi popcorn fantasia Ready Player One feels like a movie made by someone in his 20s rather than his 70s. The movie is crammed with excitement and good humor, from a rampaging King Kong to an orc with an attitude to an elaborate dip into ""The Shining."" Ready Player One's an entertaining nostalgia trip that wears its influences proudly but throws them at such dizzying force that sometimes you feel like you're buried under Chuck E. Cheese tokens. It tricks you into thinking it has the stakes, distracting with the old razzle dazzle and hoping you don't pop open the hood and kick the tires on this story, which turns out to be a lemon.

Its plot is complexity itself, but its ""kids save the world"" soul is simple and earnest as opposed to earth shattering. With apologies to Bill and Ted, it's an excellent adventure, and let's leave it at that. For every obscure sci-fi nod, there's a crowd-pleasing Spielbergian trope: Scrappy hero crushing on an independent gal? Check. Friends banding together? Got 'em. Greedy corporate villain? Yep. Mr. Spielberg navigates this warehouse with his usual dexterity, loading every frame with information without losing the clarity and momentum of the story. It is boring with an almost nuclear boringness. The special effects team create technical marvels, which are as thrilling as going on a theme-park ride. In some sense, this is the ultimate development of the fast, smooth, virtuosic style Spielberg has honed over the decades, which borrows heavily from advertising and depends on our instant recognition of fleeting visual cues. Ready Player One is entertaining enough, and it's certainly well-made, but what truly stands out is the filmmaker's prevailing-present sense of bemused disgust at the way his offspring are spending their time. The action is breathless and non-stop, both in the virtual reality and the reality reality, but wallowing in '80s nostalgia is only so much fun for so long. What extraordinary visuals this films conjures up, with images that appear and disappear like quicksilver memes. Spielberg fights mightily to keep that randomness under control, and usually succeeds. He's made a good movie. But the malleability of the story prevents it from being something more. If ""Ready Player One"" is tedious at times, it's also oodles of fun at others ... By a whisker, Spielberg wins the race against his own material. I've seen ""Ready Player One,"" and now my eyeballs need a vacation.

Life in the OASIS is exciting and wondrous to behold through your avatar's oversized anime eyes, but it doesn't mean much without some real-world stakes, and that's where the film stumbles, badly. Haptics weren't needed to feel the emotional pull of his best films; they aimed for the heart and hit much more often than they missed. ""Ready Player One"" aims for the adrenal gland. Many of the book's references to Spielberg's cultural artifacts have been stripped away, but he imbibes the movie with flashes of colour and heart that rekindle a sense of wonderment that will transport many viewers back to their childhoods. Amid this special-effects maelstrom, Wade Watts never emerges as a character, and the taciturn Sheridan is in constant danger of being out-acted by his own avatar. Who can connect with a hero when he's just watching the story? Just as Ready Player One moves back and forth between fantasy and reality, it's difficult not to admire the facility with which Spielberg oscillates between this sort of sprawling, popcorn-munching exercise and a character-driven historical drama. A lively and agreeable work of fanboy art - a first-rate film fashioned from secondhand materials. For all its faults, the movie has a sense of fun that is hard to ignore, and it's clear that it comes from a place of genuine affection for the referenced material. That's what Ready Player One ends up feeling like: a decent meal with tantalizing hints of something more complex, a Big Mac with Roquefort sprinkled on top. The plot's not going to tax anyone over the age of 12, but Spielberg crams the screen with visuals eye-popping enough to make viewers not care . For those looking for Ready Player One to condemn the digi-verse as a destructive force against human connection, find another movie. Spielberg's mindbending joyride won't quit even when the head-spinning spectacle hits sensory overload. Game on. It overuses '80s nostalgia as shorthand for genuine emotional involvement, and it presents us with a rapturous digital wonderworld only to sternly lecture us that reality is the better value. What the film lacks in substance, it makes up for in style. Ready Player One has no obligation to be a rigorous intellectual exercise, even if it amounts to a wasted opportunity...it doesn't have to be so facile, either. Maybe next time the screenwriters shouldn't set the difficulty mode to easy.

Do you really want to pay to watch an actor playing a kid who in turn plays what amounts to a video game? Feels as if it were made inside the mind of a kid obsessed with robots. While the sappy boy-and-his-robot drama pales next to the terrific ""The Iron Giant,"" the actual 'bot battles are vicarious fun. [Real Steel] borrows so much from other films that it might better be titled Reel Steal: not only from The Champ, but from Rocky, the Transformers movies and even some Star Wars. There's nothing real about Real Steel except its shameless desire to please by going where better and more successful movies have gone before.

Despite stylish direction by Francis Lawrence and hints of deeper themes about female agency in a world dominated by callous men, the movie never really rises above pulp. The cast excels at transcending its material. The script by Justin Haythe matches Francis Lawrence's direction; it's workmanlike and steady and pretty flat.

The cast excels at transcending its material. The script by Justin Haythe matches Francis Lawrence's direction; it's workmanlike and steady and pretty flat. The film, obviously, is a joke, yet tragically unaware of it. Lawrence reunites with her 'Hunger Games' director for a sadistic, sexed-up, Russian spy saga that is one long ""Nyet."" ""Red Sparrow"" defaults to stodgy when its story isn't dishing out the book's explicit sex and violence (including attempted rape), with lines and scenes that feel flat and obligatory alternating with ones that have no trouble holding our attention. Red Sparrow is a brutal, muddled and dispiriting watch, but it may inadvertently be one of the more accurate screen depictions of the messy world of espionage. This is not a recommendation. ""Red Sparrow"" isn't trashy fun like ""Atomic Blonde"" and it certainly doesn't have the brains of a ""Tinker, Tailor, Solider, Spy."" ""Red Sparrow"" clearly aspires to be a spy thriller in the classic tradition - all the elements are in place. It's the execution that's woefully lacking. Red Sparrow isn't a good movie, and that's too bad, because you can see what it might have been. The story has intrigue built into it in a way that probably made perfect sense on the page; it just doesn't translate onto the big screen. It has the soul of a washing machine instruction manual. I can't recall when I last saw a film that works so hard to stop you enjoying it. Events make sense, though parts of the plot are hard to follow, but they don't make you grin with anticipation or gasp with excitement. There are gorgeous exteriors of Vienna, Budapest, London and lush hotel interiors. The soundtrack is Tchaikovsky and Mozart. It's like an extended ad for Chanel, except for all the gore. Figuring out whether someone is a double, triple, or quadruple agent isn't a brain-teaser, it's a brain-irritant, especially when the script is so convoluted. Ms. Lawrence goes all in, seamlessly meeting the movie's physical demands - whether she's dancing onstage or crawling in blood - while turning Dominika into a character who grows more real with each unreal scene. On balance, Red Sparrow is a reasonable choice for those who don't mind a fair amount of graphic sex and violence mixed in with the spying, back-stabbing, and double-dealing expected from this genre. Shocking and violent sequences become repetitive and gratuitous, making Red Sparrow feel more like a cheap exercise in exploitation than a visceral tale of survival. Some interesting ideas, but ultimately just another film using sexual violence as a plot point. With Cold War tensions arising again in real life, Red Sparrow feels of this time in a cool way, but only Lawrence's spy is memorable in this so-so operation. A densely plotted, lurid and rather satisfying spy spectacle whose greatest asset is a movie star showing us why she's a movie star. J. Law's spy game feels genuinely unpredictable, and not only as a career move. Destroy the patriarchy, it declares, while ogling this naked body of a woman who's just had her head bashed in.

11464,m/rise_of_the_planet_of_the_apes,"This is a genuine evolution in digital film making, matched by a razor sharp script that delivers an apetastic action blockbuster. Rise of the Planet of the Apes makes for an impressive, if predictably downbeat prequel to a franchise famous for unhappy endings. Rarely has a story about the end of the world seemed so boring. This seventh film in the Planet of the Apes series rises to such ridiculous heights, it's impossible not to laugh out loud -- in a good way, in appreciation. Its human characters are ciphers, even if the actors include Franco, Lithgow, Brian Cox and Freida Pinto, but its animal rebels are utterly convincing. If you've ever seen or heard about a ""Planet of the Apes"" movie, you know where this is leading. But that doesn't make the trip any less enjoyable. It's just an apes-on-the-rampage creature feature, with a decent setup, a wobbly second act, and a glorified-videogame urban-action payoff.

It's just an apes-on-the-rampage creature feature, with a decent setup, a wobbly second act, and a glorified-videogame urban-action payoff. Conjured through the ever-expanding magic of performance-capture technology, the apes are easily the most compelling elements of Apes. The first half (presumably where most of the narrative scenes were excised) is frustratingly arrhythmic; more satisfying is the ape revolution of the final half-hour, a scary and deftly handled passage. With its skillful blend of live action and motion-capture technology, it's a handsomely made prequel to familiar monkey business. It is not what could be fairly called a bad movie, but neither is it fine enough to be a good one, with its lineup of dull characters and a limp story that functions like a conveyor belt. Rises above its dramatic deficits, boosts the collective IQ of this summer's movies and swings into flights of kinetic fantasy that blow the collective mind. This movie is a worthy claimant to the simian throne and the rare summer blockbuster that gets more, not less, fun as it goes along. Swift and nimble, like the rising ape at its center, ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is gratifyingly free of the usual big-budget blockbuster weight and volume. As both a simian simile and a wonder of technology, Rise of the Planet of the Apes deserves to be in the company of the great original Kong. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" does it right. Smart, fun and thoroughly enjoyable, it's a model summer diversion that entertains without insulting your intelligence. Rise of the Planet of the Apes rises and, at times, even soars - all thanks to what human actors in league with computer technology can now achieve to bring the apes to life. You may, like me, skulk into the new ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes'' expecting the worst. And you may, like me, be genuinely surprised by where this movie takes you. Having gone in with very low expectations, this reviewer was totally blown away by Rise of the Planet of the Apes. It might just be the most pleasant shock of 2011. In the oeuvre of Planet of the Apes pics - four sequels to the original, and the 2001 Tim Burton-directed remake - Rise is certainly not the most interesting, nor the most inventive. But it's not risible, either. Everything Burton's movie wasn't -- smart, exciting and thought-provoking, while operating in the realm of the movies' great misunderstood monsters. Caesar's prison conversion to charismatic pan-ape revolutionist is near-silent filmmaking, with simple and precise images illustrating Caesar's General-like divining of personalities and his organization of a group from chaos to order. The central problem with Rise of the Planet of the Apes is that it feels more like a piece of something larger than a complete motion picture. ...very nearly close to completely awesome, and is the best sci-fi blockbuster of the summer, in a walk, even. Precisely the kind of summer diversion that the studios have such a hard time making now. It's good, canny-dumb fun. Strong action, special effects and by far the most credible ape ""performances"" yet seen will spell box office to inspire chest-thumping in all markets. I kind of enjoyed ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" despite its evident silliness and the fact that nobody's likely to remember it three weeks from now. Wyatt ... keeps the action compelling whether focusing on apes as they run amok or as they quietly contemplate their next move. An odd blend of silly popcorn entertainment and sometimes startling poignancy. One never knows exactly where the human ends and the effects begin, but Serkis and/or Caesar gives the best performance in the movie. Wyatt's version, scripted by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver (who previously teamed for The Relic), pays tribute to the original series without being bound by it.

But it seldom puts the brakes on a story that moves toward a furious ape-human rumble, not in a jungle, but atop the Golden Gate Bridge.

It's faint praise to say that this is the best of the ""Planet of the Apes"" movies, because the evolution of special effects and makeup was predictable. But the unexpected strength of the film is its heart. The running time is efficient, the direction is clean, the story is simple but resonant, the effects are understated yet impressive, and the near-wordless star of the show puts on an acting clinic. They probably should have called it ""Beneath the Dignity of the Planet of the Apes,"" but ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is tolerable if you'll just keep in mind that the original feature was an overachieving B-movie.

The film gets notably dumber as it continues, culminating in a final battle overstuffed with unlikely and ill-conceived moments shot in overwrought slow-motion close-up. Robin Hood is head and shoulders above the sort of lightheaded epics Hollywood typically offers during the summer season. If this truly is Ridley Scott's preferred cut, he has proven unable to justify the existence of yet another Robin Hood film. What this Robin Hood lacks in fun it makes up for in epic sweep. Despite its abundant flaws and historical howlers and generally dimwitted tone, Robin Hood is a surprisingly enjoyable work of popcorn cinema, if you're willing to take it on its own terms. The film recasts the classic tale as a super-serious, social-realist tract about feudalism, tyranny, murky photography and how horrid those French were. If the word ""prequel"" means that there's a sequel, I'm looking forward to it. It's an ersatz epic about men in fights -- grim fights, grinding battles, clanking combats that are repetitive and, in a movie that runs 140 minutes, all but endless. Robin Hood boasts graphic battle scenes and ingenious intrigue, a sense of history that may not be accurate but feels authentic, and a love story that smartly plays with gender and Hollywood stereotypes. It doesn't breathe new life into a genre as did Gladiator, Scott's first pairing with Russell Crowe, but it's a brawny reimagining of a beloved old myth, a period popcorn movie turned out with professionalism and gusto. While Scott is one of the few directors who could field-marshal this sort of spectacle and still deliver a coherent film, simply ending up with a fitfully engaging behemoth of a movie isn't accomplishment enough. The endless plot twists may be perplexing, but they work to make the movie feel eventful and involving: after 140 minutes, audiences will feel like they've been somewhere, lived through something. A lot of care went into crafting the handsome production but not enough into making the handsome hero come alive. If 200 arrows fly through the woods, do they make a sound? Perhaps the worst, and most shameless, aspect of this tedious affair is that it's essentially a prequel for the Robin Hood better known for his redistribution of wealth. Robin Hood turns out to be, despite impressive battle scenes and countless horses, an actor's showcase. If Ridley Scott's aim was to bewilder, then Robin Hood must be counted a storming success. From the opening scene, we are offered little idea of who is doing what to whom. As for why: forget it. Robin Hood achieves something you never would have thought possible: it makes you nostalgic for Kevin Costner and Bryan Adams. I liked it. It's on a par with Scott's American Gangster: No revelations, but a satisfying, large-scale genre movie, toned up by its cast. Robin Hood is a high-tech and well made violent action picture using the name of Robin Hood for no better reason than that it's an established brand not protected by copyright.

It's an ersatz epic about men in fights -- grim fights, grinding battles, clanking combats that are repetitive and, in a movie that runs 140 minutes, all but endless. Robin Hood boasts graphic battle scenes and ingenious intrigue, a sense of history that may not be accurate but feels authentic, and a love story that smartly plays with gender and Hollywood stereotypes. It doesn't breathe new life into a genre as did Gladiator, Scott's first pairing with Russell Crowe, but it's a brawny reimagining of a beloved old myth, a period popcorn movie turned out with professionalism and gusto. While Scott is one of the few directors who could field-marshal this sort of spectacle and still deliver a coherent film, simply ending up with a fitfully engaging behemoth of a movie isn't accomplishment enough. The endless plot twists may be perplexing, but they work to make the movie feel eventful and involving: after 140 minutes, audiences will feel like they've been somewhere, lived through something. A lot of care went into crafting the handsome production but not enough into making the handsome hero come alive. If 200 arrows fly through the woods, do they make a sound? Perhaps the worst, and most shameless, aspect of this tedious affair is that it's essentially a prequel for the Robin Hood better known for his redistribution of wealth. Robin Hood turns out to be, despite impressive battle scenes and countless horses, an actor's showcase. If Ridley Scott's aim was to bewilder, then Robin Hood must be counted a storming success. From the opening scene, we are offered little idea of who is doing what to whom. As for why: forget it. Robin Hood achieves something you never would have thought possible: it makes you nostalgic for Kevin Costner and Bryan Adams. I liked it. It's on a par with Scott's American Gangster: No revelations, but a satisfying, large-scale genre movie, toned up by its cast. Robin Hood is a high-tech and well made violent action picture using the name of Robin Hood for no better reason than that it's an established brand not protected by copyright. Simultaneously simplistic and over-plotted, revisionist and predictable... As in so many summer behemoths, the real stars are the projectiles-in this case, arrows with their own point-of-view shots, zipping through the air and finding their targets with pinpoint accuracy. Damned if those dual spoilsports, the gladiatorial director Ridley Scott reteamed with his portly star Russell Crowe, haven't drained every drop of merriment right out of the myth. If it's sword-on-sword with arrows-in-the-air action you want, Robin Hood delivers in a big way. It's a resolutely grim and grubby lesson in 13th-century British history filtered through all the requisite trademarks of a summer blockbuster. There is a whole lot of meanwhile in this crowded, lumbering film. The action's here, there, and everywhere... but all this to-ing and fro-ing fails to advance the narrative with the compelling force you crave in movies. The Robin Hood of myth and moviedom is for the most part AWOL. Why should we have to wait until the last five minutes to see Crowe crack a smile, let alone split an arrow? Instead of the usual romantic adventure, Scott and screenwriter Brian Helgeland offer a gritty drama, using the Robin Hood story to depict the birth pangs of liberty. They ground the film in the details of medieval life. In one unfortunate regard, Ridley Scott's grimy Robin Hood lives up to the actions of its legendary character: It, too, robs -- but just from richer movies. Pretty much ill-conceived from the ground up but saved by a couple of strong performances and a wealth of well-researched period detail. Not the most elegant defense, but like the movie, it'll do.

Ridley Scott's spin on the classic Robin Hood yarn starts out with great promise, but by the time 140 minutes tick away and the film collapses into Hollywood cliché and convention, the audience is half expecting to hear Bryan Adams' Everything I Do. ""And so the legend begins,"" the new movie tells us at the end. But it's too late. Robin and Marian are played by a scowling Russell Crowe and a grim Cate Blanchett, who has the face of a wooden squaw stained by decades of cigar smoke. I can't remember a more un-fun-looking couple.

11546,m/rogue_one_a_star_wars_story,"This spin-off/prequel has the same primitive, lived-in, emotional, loopy, let's-put-on-a-show spirit that made us fall in love with the original trilogy. It offers more details of interoffice politics among the squabbling factions of both the Empire and the Rebel Alliance than probably anyone but a mid-level manager cares for. Yet you generally feel you're in good hands. It's a downer. It's morally tangled. The characters are as depressed as the scenario, and Michael Giacchino's music can't make it better. If you're not a fan, Rogue One may not be the revelation that The Force Awakens turned out to be. But it won't have you wishing for your own personal Death Star either. ""Rogue One"" is definitive proof: ""Star Wars"" is back, baby. Rogue One features stirring action scenes, vivid characterisation and one or two truly eye-popping explosions. Nonetheless, what it lacks is any real originality. Doesn't break the mold in terms of franchise formula, and it's an enjoyable installment in the ""Star Wars"" canon. However, it's not much more than that. Much more than a mere sideshow in the Star Wars saga, these rebels build on a brilliant legacy. Rogue One is a bright light in the Star Wars canon. Edwards has created the rare Star Wars property that can be appreciated as a film. And it is about as violent and downbeat as Star Wars gets on the big screen-more downbeat than The Empire Strikes Back, in fact. Towering like a stick-man over the rest of the cast, K-2SO provides most of the laughs in this portentous voyage into that same old galaxy far, far away. In the end, this hardening of the franchise seems likely to alienate both the fans and the uninitiated. ""Rogue One"" represents an unobjectionable exercise in franchise extension. It's fine. It'll do. For now. The movie has a completely different, more sophisticated feel than most recent special effects-driven entries, including last year's so-so ""The Force Awakens."" It tries so hard to be an epic masterpiece - with self-important speeches and an insanely outsize orchestral score - that it ends up a laughable parody of itself. ""Rogue One"" stands on its own, an entry that is at once part of the ""Star Wars"" franchise (obviously) but also separate - a tougher, grittier film. Almost pedantic in its inoffensiveness. All the pieces are there ... like Lego figures in a box. The problem is that the filmmakers haven't really bothered to think of anything very interesting to do with them. The action sequences, both on the ground and in space, are rousingly staged. But the losses incurred in those sequences are sobering. The stakes in the ""Star Wars"" rebellion are high indeed. Rogue One isn't so much a movie as a feature-length promotional film for itself; it's a movie that is still waiting to be made. Rogue One is a bold and stirring adventure film that will have both fans and casual observers spellbound. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story does exactly what it is supposed to do by incrementally expanding the Star Wars universe that we already know. Hard-core fans who thought Episode VII was a dumbed-down rehash will bask in an action-packed film that refuses to spoon-feed information. Mind you, that's the same reason why the casual fan will be disengaged. This is a whole new stable of characters operating on the fringes of the world we know by heart. When you think about it, that's pretty exciting. And it opens up a world of cinematic possibilities moving forward. It stands alone as the best Star Wars entry since 1980's The Empire Strikes Back. Yes, it's that good. Rogue One is groundbreaking for the Star Wars franchise, a rousing side story that blows the doors wide open for future installments of the series. That it stands on its own as a slam-bam action thrill ride is a bonus. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story answers the question of whether that galaxy far, far away is big enough to sustain multiple offshoots with an emphatic yes. Rogue One is a more-than-worthy prequel. Which is a first in the Star Wars universe. Rogue One is better than [the prequels] by a long shot, but after the high bar set by last year's Episode VII - The Force Awakens, simply being better than the prequels isn't good enough anymore. The Force Awakens may have reanimated the once-dormant franchise, but it's Rogue One that will give Star Wars fans a new hope. K-2S0 contributes sorely needed humor, but nowhere near enough. Despite its darker tone, Rogue One feels cosily at home in the Star Wars universe, and is crowded with the kind of imagination-tickling details the franchise thrives on. Even an underwhelming Star Wars is a pretty decent Star Wars, but Rogue One misses a real chance to turn the familiar into something remarkable. A little bit ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" a little bit ""Dirty Dozen"" in its mass wartime slaughter, and a pretty good time once it gets going. For all its vivid visual imagination, the film left me almost totally cold. And I say that as a man who has cried actual tears at more than one Star Wars movie. A swiftly paced, rough-and-ready entertainment that, in anticipating the canonical events of ""A New Hope,"" manages the tricky feat of seeming at once casually diverting and hugely consequential. In a series of by-the-bible films, this is the iconoclastic one. And that's its charm. Rogue One manages to succeed as both super-nerdy fan service and the first entry since the 1977 original that will satisfy people who have never seen a Star Wars film. For the original generation of ""Star Wars"" fans who weren't sure what to make of episodes one, two, and three, ""Rogue One"" is the prequel they've always wanted. This movie is about the journey, not the destination. And the journey is about as exciting as a long drive down the Florida Turnpike. Despite a galaxy of potential and a number of killer moments, Gareth Edwards' Star Wars spinoff feels painfully forced. Its variations on a theme are muscular and adroit. This is another really entertaining fantasy with fan-fiction energy and attack. A punchy standalone action tale about a spunky Rebel Alliance resistance group. The Star Wars franchise has built up a massive amount of cachet over the last several decades; Rogue One is going to need every bit of it. Loaded with more battle action than any of its seven predecessors, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story plays like a set-up for the events in the 1977 original and, for the most part, does so quite entertainingly. Yes, it's part of a series that is now eight movies strong, but it also works alone as a movie about war, oppression, a dangerous heist, a daring rebellion and a spark of hope that ignites the final stages of a revolution. This ""Star Wars"" spinoff doesn't spin very far off from the franchise, but it's a serviceable stopgap between chapters. Seems to want nothing more than for the audience to pat itself on the back because they know what Yavin 4 is: It's a fun game to play at Comic-Con, but it doesn't make for much of a movie.

Jon Stewart's filmmaking debut ""Rosewater"" has much in common with ""The Daily Show"" - it's blaringly obvious, it's naive, it plays to the cheap seats and it's enamored with cheap jokes. Stewart acquits himself solidly, though not thrillingly, as a beginning director ... Stewart's wryly observant qualities as a TV star serve him well in his feature film debut. What makes ""Rosewater"" different from similar entries in what might be called the Triumph of the Imprisoned Spirit genre is that the hero is hardly an ideologue, despite having sympathy for the Iranian reformers and the Green party. While the film keeps telling us that Bahari survived his ordeal by freeing his mind from imprisonment and eventually outsmarting his rosewater-scented interrogator, we are told that he's doing so more than we're seeing it. Mr. Stewart's interest in the material is obviously personal, but his movie transcends mere self-interest. A finely wrought, powerful drama that tells the true story of an Iranian-born journalist's imprisonment and torture by the Islamic regime in Iran. Stewart lets the truth roll out, the best he can, believing in the sanitizing effect of sunlight and the inevitable fate that awaits all despots. With Rosewater, Stewart proves he can pull back from the satirical comedy and become a thoughtful, incisive and questioning filmmaker.

The gripping, intelligent directorial debut of TV personality Jon Stewart, who also wrote the screenplay, based on Bahari's post-prison memoir, ""Then They Came For Me."" It's a movie made for people who prefer to take their politics while sitting on the couch. Stewart's enthusiasm for his story and passion about injustice ring clear, but throughout what could have been a dreadfully somber film, he remembers to breathe. A strong, striking political drama. This is Jon Stewart's directorial debut; the talk show comedian has a handle on the material and conveys it clearly.

The hard-focus clarity of the images (Bobby Bukowski did the cinematography) leads to an intimacy with anguish that passes into expressionism.

The main question Rosewater grapples with is whether Stewart can hack it as a filmmaker. The answer: sort of? Rosewater certainly has merit as an act of atonement on Stewart's part and a tribute to people like Bahari... In the end, however, the movie needs to stand on its own, apart from its noble intentions and the popularity of its writer-director.

Complain as loudly as you like about Oliver Stone - his politics, posturing and relationship with the facts - but until now he hasn't directed a film that's flat-out dull.

You might not think that a motion picture called ""Savages"" could be too violent, too savage, but you would be wrong. How did this film end up with such a muddled story?

But also a lot of fun, especially as its pulp elements rub up against some gritty geopolitical and economic themes. Savages is Oliver Stone doing what he should have done a long time ago: making a tricky, amoral, down-and-dirty crime thriller that's blessedly free of any social, topical, or political relevance.

A sneakily effective work of manipulation that should charm family audiences through the holiday season and beyond. In a Hollywood where men still pen 85% of all films, there's something sour in a movie that roots against a woman who asserted her artistic control by asking to be a co-screenwriter. Even if this comes off like an ad for Disney, it's convincing and contains some of Disney's patented magic -- especially with a predictable, yet effective, emotional ending. Saving Mr. Banks turns Travers's tense collaboration with Walt and his team of Imagineers into -- naturally -- a schmaltzy journey of closure, climaxing in a teary screening of the finished musical. Just as Travers is eventually won over by her Hollywood adversaries, the strong sentimental pull of ''Saving Mr. Banks'' overwhelms, too. A sneakily effective work of manipulation that should charm family audiences through the holiday season and beyond. In a Hollywood where men still pen 85% of all films, there's something sour in a movie that roots against a woman who asserted her artistic control by asking to be a co-screenwriter. Even if this comes off like an ad for Disney, it's convincing and contains some of Disney's patented magic -- especially with a predictable, yet effective, emotional ending. Saving Mr. Banks turns Travers's tense collaboration with Walt and his team of Imagineers into -- naturally -- a schmaltzy journey of closure, climaxing in a teary screening of the finished musical. Just as Travers is eventually won over by her Hollywood adversaries, the strong sentimental pull of ''Saving Mr. Banks'' overwhelms, too. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" wraps a seduction inside a seduction with enjoyable results. It's a Disney film in every sense of the term. Nobody plays huffy like Thompson, who seems to sniff with her entire body; she's wonderfully funny against Hanks' effusive Disney. Travers would have despised it. For the rest of us it's an entertaining, affecting, deftly acted saga, interspersed with illustrative flashbacks from Travers' childhood. Like the Mary Poppins film Disney would eventually serve up, Saving Mr. Banks is an affable, enjoyable spoonful of sugar that sweetens into palatability the sinus-clearing bite of the books - and the implacable iron lady who wrote them. Saving Mr. Banks is hard to beat as holiday entertainment. Endure the dull melodrama, and give thanks that the sugar in the rest of the film is doled out by the spoonful, not the shovelful. Thanks to Thompson and Hanks, this movie about the making of a movie hits the sweet spot. There's magic in it. Even with Thompson's delectably dyspeptic portrayal of Travers, she'd be a difficult protagonist to root for, were it not for the back story of ""Mary Poppins"" that ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is really about. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is extremely canny and often great fun, primarily in the scenes in which Travers locks horns with the Disney-ites. There's something a little incestuous about a studio making a movie about one of its greatest box office triumphs. But Disney's backstage drama about how its whimsical 1964 kids' classic Mary Poppins came to be is a delight. What makes ""Saving Mr. Banks"" work is Thompson in a wonderful, nuanced performance that walks a fine line between villain and heroine. It's enthralling fun to watch Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) focus his charm and instinct on flinty British novelist P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) as he campaigns to film her Mary Poppins. Rest assured that, by the end, a little pixie dust will solve everything. If ""Saving Mr. Banks"" were 100 percent false and yet felt true, that would be fine. But this has the self-conscious whiff, if not of mendacity, then of public relations. The slick but moving ""Saving Mr. Banks"" transcends its corporate pedigree to become a great Disney movie about making a Disney movie. The sharper edges of the Disney/Travers relationship, well-documented by various sources, have been rounded off, but the actors suggest what they can, where they can. The best parts of ""Saving Mr. Banks"" offer an embellished, tidied-up but nonetheless reasonably authentic glimpse of the Disney entertainment machine at work. The irony of Saving Mr. Banks is that it takes this true story of Hollywood conflict, of artistic integrity pitted against studio moxie, and gives it the same warm-and-fuzzy treatment the company gave Poppins.

For a movie that's all about what a swell idea it was to adapt Mary Poppins for the screen, Saving Mr. Banks seems remarkably uninterested in what made the movie special. Thompson is very good at playing imperious, and she even manages an unexpected trace of flirtiness in a few offhanded moments with Hanks. I found it interminable. The picture finally succeeds as the kind of fantasy that its two main characters consorted in, individually and, on one project, together. A desperately Oscar-hungry contrivance whose only hope lies with the terrific Thompson. An intoxicating kiddie cocktail for young-at-heart adults ...

The screenplay, by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith, seamlessly captures two different eras with overlapping story lines that never intrude or confuse. Saving Mr Banks is a merciless film. It hits you with every sentimental low blow it can think of. Then it pounds you again. And when you're down, it jumps on you. The movie avoids commonplace traps; it never becomes maudlin and it doesn't transform Travers into a likeable elderly lady whose heart of gold is camouflaged by crotchetiness. Beneath Banks' crass self-aggrandizement lies a pretty charming portrait of two overly proud people butting creative heads. Yes, charming. That's what Disney does, and it does it well enough to turn even this condescending pap into something palatable. Most people will come away from Saving Mr. Banks feeling like they just sat through a feature-length ad for the magic of Walt Disney, with P.L. Travers' life tacked on as an afterthought.

""Selma"" invites viewers to heed its story, meditate on its implications and allow those images once again to change our hearts and minds. An insightful look into the making of a historic moment; Oyelowo raises the roof as MLK. Hollywood's definitive depiction of the 1960s American civil rights movement - as well as perhaps the most timely movie you'll see this year. Meticulously researched and elegantly scripted by debuting screenwriter Paul Webb, Selma toggles between moments big and small, though everything feels necessary. With Selma, DuVernay has pulled off a tricky feat, a movie based on historical events that never feels dull, worthy, or lifeless; it hangs together as a story and not just part of a lesson plan. As cinema, Selma is commendable; as cultural barometer, it's beyond reproach. This is real American history being made, you think - and regular Americans making it. But then, those are the Americans who always do. DuVernay's look at Martin Luther King's 1965 voting-rights march against racial injustice stings with relevance to the here and now. Oyelowo's stirring, soulful performance as King deserves superlatives. This is an intellectual approach to an emotional issue - and it delivers, powerfully and beautifully.

Directed with confidence by Ava DuVernay, it's a movie about how King changed America by having the canny political genius to show the country an image of itself that it could not bear. This is a film about work: the work at hand, the work it takes to do the work, and, for an audience in 2015, the question of whether the work worked. DuVernay has made a film that is less about easy catharsis or reignited fury than it is a drama that speaks of the vision, strategic discipline, and political wrangling required to maintain and grow democracy. Like Dr. King did, the film captures your mind and your heart as it entertains, the way great movies often do. An uneven yet generally skillful effort that has probably drawn more praise and criticism than it warrants. This is what Selma dares to do so well: show us the small, private moments in King's life, the intimacies, the humanity.

With its blend of low-rent gangster cool, high-body-count hipster violence, smart-mouth dialogue, inspired casting and a blissfully retro soundtrack...[this]might have been a groundbreaking film -- in 1992. For a good hour, Seven Psychopaths is lively, bloody fun. Then the yawning starts. 'Seven Psychopaths"" is many things, chief among them a long-overdue love letter to Christopher Walken and a crudely drawn ransom note from Sam Rockwell. Movies about moviemaking can often feel lazy -- like rock songs about touring, or poetry about sitting in cafes -- but McDonagh is such an energetic filmmaker and fancy-footed writer that he nearly pulls it off. I can't remember the last time I was so sorely disappointed by a writer I liked; the movie is undeniably entertaining but as hollow as a bullet wound. In writer-director Martin McDonagh's hazy but fun meditation on friendship, the art of storytelling and masculine morality gone off the rails. If it's hard to keep 'em all straight without a scorecard, just go with it. Even if the snake winds up swallowing its own tail, it's a jolting spectacle you'll want to keep watching. It's an old-fashioned John Huston caper film extended to sulfurous comedy - from Beat the Devil to Meet the Devil. The really crazy thing about Seven Psychopaths is how much sense it makes, in a weird sort of way. And how much fun it has while doing so. It comes off as a big inside joke. And not a very funny one at that. McDonagh's characters may be awful, or simply lost, but they're all addicted to the art of the tall tale and the dark allure of the nightmarish bedtime story. Doesn't leave much behind beyond a trail of blood, wit, and confusion, but it's something to see while it lasts. Well, they have the title right. I don't know how these people found one another, but they certainly belong on the same list. ""Seven Psychopaths"" has to be counted as a disappointment. A collection of weird riffs that not even engaging acting by Colin Farrell, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson, Christopher Walken and Tom Waits can bring together. ""Seven Psychopaths"" is a vivid illusion of fun, but sane consumers can find similar sensations in the discount video bin eight days a week. Meta to the max, filled with clever jokes and observations that stick like barbs and deflated ones that land with a thud, ""Seven Psychopaths"" is a leisurely riff about movies, violence, storytelling and the art of the steal. What movie junkie out there wouldn't leap at the chance to see merry pranksters such as Christopher Walken, Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson go nuts in something called Seven Psychopaths? It's crazy-killer fun. The violence wears you down. Like one of its nutso characters, ""Seven Psychopaths"" has a death wish. There's something overtly mechanical about McDonagh's approach that keeps it all from being as outrageously fun as it's pretending to be.

All this narrative nesting and genre-skipping sounds very cerebral on the page, but in practice, Seven Psychopaths is as pleasurably kinetic as can be, full of double-crosses and gunplay and sun-kissed SoCal locations. Each time it appears that McDonagh, who also directed, has written himself into a cul de sac, he off-roads the movie (sometimes literally) into fresh territory. Yes, it's a lot to keep track of, but writer-director Martin McDonagh does so with deft humor as the film hurls toward a desert climax, foreshadowed in one of Billy and Marty's exchanges. For about 75 minutes, Seven Psychopaths is a rollicking good movie - kinetic, clever, funny, and brutal. Then, inexplicably, it falls apart. McDonagh sets real (and very different) moods for his stories-within-stories. The Los Angeles locations - apart from the obligatory Hollywood sign - seem fresh. This flick never pretends to be anything but a bright hall of fun-house mirrors. And there, so gloriously distorted, gargoyles look right at home. While ""Seven Psychopaths"" is indeed as crazy as it sounds, it's not nearly as smart as it thinks it is. Too many of its moments of let's-subvert-the-genre seem to leave McDonagh stranded and flailing at just the moment when a Tarantino movie or a Chuck Palahniuk novel is snapping into place. A toxic little bauble of Hollywood gestures, cliches and tropes.

Fassbender's performance here is riveting, haunting. He immerses himself and makes you feel as if you're truly watching a man hell-bent on exorcising his demons through compulsive self-destruction. One thing's for sure: McQueen has found his De Niro, and he better keep him close. Was that an angel of hope riding to work on the Lexington Avenue local? Does the Lord really live in this cold, ethereal New York City? And is anyone even interested? One shot of a shattered Brandon standing in the rain without a clue of where to turn gets more done than any of McQueen's flourishes, frankly. But you can't blame a onetime conceptual artist for trying... McQueen has taken an unflinching and non-judgmental view of sexual addiction in Shame.

The biggest surprise in Shame is how distanced, passionless, and merely skin-deep the director's attention is - how little he cares about the subject of his own movie.

The biggest surprise in Shame is how distanced, passionless, and merely skin-deep the director's attention is - how little he cares about the subject of his own movie. It's the study of a man whose soul has been peeled away, like coring an apple. But I wouldn't call it sexy -- or entertaining. What does Brandon learn? What do we learn? This is a psychologically claustrophobic film that strips its characters bare literally and figuratively, leaving them, and us, nowhere to hide. This sleek-looking but curiously unfocused character study never quite gets down to the business of showing us who Brandon is, but boy, does Fassbender make him into a captivating enigma. These characters are stripped bare in every sense, reflecting an extreme degree of inner confusion, vulnerability and fear. Betrayed and broken as children, they now have to define and rebuild themselves as adults. Much of the film is banal or pretentious, or both -- vacuous vignettes about emptiness. Occasionally, though, those vignettes burst into life and burn with consuming fire. The wisdom of Shame is that it offers no easy exit for this prison of the mind. This one simply recycles art-movie cliches about urban alienation and passionless sex. Fassbender's portrayal is truly haunting, and when he sobs, dramatically unraveling, it's clear he's imprisoned by his physical urges. In a movie era remarkable for its reluctance to dramatize erotic intimacy, Shame merits praise for the dark energy of its sexual encounters. There is a good movie to be made about someone like Brandon, especially with someone like Fassbender, a performer of exceptional technical facility and a fascinating sense of reserve. McQueen's isn't quite it. How can visual pleasure communicate existential misery? It is a real and interesting challenge, and if ""Shame"" falls short of meeting it, the seriousness of its effort is hard to deny. This is a great act of filmmaking and acting.

Despite the impression you may have gotten strolling some of the Internet's more giggly avenues, the most riveting part of Michael Fassbender's anatomy in Shame is his face.

There's a mystery at the heart of Sherlock Holmes and it's not the one the great master of detection has been called on to solve.

It's good enough to just sit back and enjoy Downey and Law plays Holmes and Watson as Victorian versions of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Yes, this Holmes is leaner and meaner, and Watson (Jude Law) is nearly his equal. But there's still something fussy about the result, as if bobbies had broken up the party at 11:59. Put away your period-movie expectations and you just might have a lot of fun. What makes this movie work is actually something very old-fashioned: movie-star chemistry. Guy Ritchie's Holmes reboot feels both too complicated and too elementary, dear Watson. If Sherlock Holmes truly is the world's most keen detective, surely he would have sniffed out that this film was a stinker. The less I thought about Sherlock Holmes, the more I liked Sherlock Holmes.

Though purists may balk at Arthur Conan Doyle's literary world being manhandled into a blockbuster by never-subtle director Guy Ritchie, Downey has a winning take on Holmes: He's always on. What is surprising is how bland the results are. The explosions and action sequences have an odd cheapness to them and the central plot is one of those dreary take-over-the-world routines. At times, Ritchie and company try so hard to make sure this isn't your father's Sherlock Holmes that it comes across as, well, cartoonish. This is rip-roaring action-adventure of high order, a sometimes dizzying but ultimately thrilling display of showmanship on the part of the actors, director and screenwriters. Guy Ritchie is the worst screenwriter in the world, but, to be fair, he is not the worst director. He is only the worst director of the people who actually get to make movies. The game is not afoot. It seems that an evil aristocrat, executed for a series of murders, returns from the dead to mobilize an ancient secret society that he may have time-traveled into a Dan Brown novel to learn about. Doesn't that sound fascinating? I thought not. I dug it. Dazzling visuals and hipster dialogue, but a story that stays true to the original source material.

Blinded by avarice and all out of ideas, once again, Hollywood can't tell when enough is way more than enough.

Shrek the Third sticks to the swamp it knows best, in a mild climate of palatable jokes about fatherhood, high school, girl power, and a drug-education program for teens that advises ''Just Say Nay.'' Where the first two films laced their stories with references to and appearances by familiar fairy tale characters, Shrek the Third is almost totally dependent upon them. [Monty] Python-ish nuttiness is thinly scattered, but it makes the movie worth seeing -- once. Shrek the Third has its moments. But does a kids' movie really need, among other similar touches, a Hooters joke? I, for one, wouldn't want to have to explain it. The formula still works. Maybe not as well, but it works. Shrek the Third manages to [add new characters and plots] without losing sight of the series' primary appeal, the snappy subversiveness with which it upends fairy tales, nursery rhymes and legends. Those of us charmed by the original Shrek and its ability to mix fairy-tale sweetness with some hilariously grown-up cleverness will leave disappointed. Much of this feels like a retread, a cash cow without enough ideas to justify its existence. There's never the sense of a movie begging for laughs by throwing in anachronisms. The jokes are organic to the movie, to its sly and slightly caustic worldview, and they don't stop coming, from start to finish. There's no disguising the fact that Shrek the Third has come down with a bad case of sequelitis. You know the symptoms: Lots of razzle-dazzle to distract from the hole at the center of the story. You know, the place where fresh ideas should be. It's fitfully amusing, and only 80 minutes long. As far as the adventures of Shrek go, it grieves me to report that the third time is charmless. If you're into the last two installments, you'll find the same laughs here. Nothing more, nothing less. At least this sequel finally establishes how many licks it takes to finish off a popular fairy tale spoof. Three. It makes the mistake of thinking slapstick action is funny for its own sake. True, characters zooming and bouncing around are easy to write because no creative invention is required to set them in motion. But so what? The charm has evaporated. Cinephiles will enjoy some of the in-jokes (watching an awful play, one character cracks, ""This is worse than Love Letters""). But then, if you're a cinephile, why would you bother with this? I doubt even rabid fans of the first two will consider Shrek the Third a worthy addition to the franchise. Director Chris Miller and the credited writers are determined that if these films are to be a collection of riffs and gags, with a sweet afterthought for a finale, then they ought to be very good. And, largely, these are. Geez, it's not very good. Talky, overpopulated, even the ha-ha so-called adult jokes have grown stale and predictable.

The world of the fanciful fable looks particularly vibrant this time with its signature blend of realism and fantasy. It is a pleasure to watch these fairy tale folk be themselves -- yet again. What the characters and satirical situations may lack this time out in a certain fresh vitality, they more than compensate for with a warm, laid-back familiarity ... and the occasional, out-of-left-fjord surprise. The series is showing signs of aging, from the predictably jokey store signs (Versarchery, Abercrombie and Witch) to the classic-rock instrumentals playing under the fight scenes. Shrek may have been first, but revisionist fairy tales have become more common than the real thing, and this sequel should have done more to differentiate itself.

When Day of the Soldado truly wallows in violence, it does so exquisitely, with the kind of hopelessness that film violence, especially around this subject matter, should convey. Director Stefano Sollima eschews the quiet suspense of the original in favor of hard-core action. And the execution is nearly flawless. A needless sequel that serves only to deepen one's appreciation of the original's tightwire act and suggests that screenwriter Taylor Sheridan's moral ambivalence about American power ended with the Obama presidency. ""Sicario: Day of the Soldado"" is pretty gory, very grim and kind of depressing. So before you buy your ticket, know what you're signing up for. But you're probably going to regret enlisting anyway. When Day of the Soldado truly wallows in violence, it does so exquisitely, with the kind of hopelessness that film violence, especially around this subject matter, should convey. Director Stefano Sollima eschews the quiet suspense of the original in favor of hard-core action. And the execution is nearly flawless. The world expands in this follow-up, but it's just as cynical and hopeless as we remember. Hey, there are some sick one-liners, and somewhere in the convoluted plot is a heart-pumping chiller of a story with no easy heroes.

Hey, there are some sick one-liners, and somewhere in the convoluted plot is a heart-pumping chiller of a story with no easy heroes. More predictable are many of the stylistic moves made by Sollima who, like Guonadottir, has been hired to replicate an existing template. He succeeds nonetheless in keeping us on edge. The two main adult male characters might look and act like brutal nihilists, but don't worry. By the end, they put the ""I care"" in ""Sicario"" and remind everyone that you can't spell ""Soldado"" without ""Dad."" Day of the Soldado is too sober and grim for the sweaty heat of Touch of Evil. But it has taken to heart one of its best lines: ""All border towns bring out the worst in a country."" This is a sequel which works well enough as a thriller but whose political perspective is wayward and often disturbing, especially when the full weight of the United States military is unleashed. If anything, Sicario 2: Soldado will only fuel the toxic discourse around the perceived crises of immigration, terrorism and organised crime.

At its mean, snakelike best, it's also a brutally assured commercial action picture, unburdened by the moral qualms or unnerving ambiguity of its predecessor. {Soldado] dithers away into subplots, including one that is ludicrously contrived and seems designed to continue the franchise. Soldado is beautifully crafted and requires some brain cells. Day of the Soldado -- a sequel that wasn't exactly needed, which proceeds to raise complicated issues that the movie, with its simple-minded formula, isn't particularly well equipped to handle. While ""Sicario"" didn't exactly beg to be a film franchise, ""Soldado"" proves it'll go as long as Brolin and Del Toro can stay corrupt and captivating. Somehow Soldado gets by, thanks to strong performances. A little goes a long way, and despite the presence of the sleepily charismatic del Toro-his beleaguered Alejandro carries heavy baggage both in his heart and beneath his eyes-the Soldado man show does grow tiresome. ""Sicario: Day of the Soldado"" is a sequel that barely justifies its existence. Although Day of the Soldado isn't as powerful as Sicario, it's a worthy follow-up. Soldado bludgeons its way into touchy border politics, and maybe lucks its way into a story focused on the moral imperative of protecting a single child. It's a given that sequels are never as good as the original movie, but Sicario: Day of The Soldado, is worth seeing. So what does the sequel, ""Sicario: Day of the Soldado,"" do? It gets rid of almost everything that worked so well in the original. Shocking. Bold. Timely. Unforgettable. And a little bit nuts. THIS is how you make a sequel. The trouble with this muscular, fitfully absorbing, confusingly titled action movie - a bigger, brasher and less memorable picture than its predecessor in every respect - is that its cynicism too often feels like a put-on. A much more conventional film with fewer pretensions to high art. Violence exploited for mere entertainment is so commonplace it hardly seems worth noting. Josh Brolin growls as the CIA. The music growls too: a daring continuo of doomy bass discords. And with so many blood-spraying deaths you should think of wearing a sou'wester. Soldado skillfully mixes its real-world grounding with a flair for pulpy, moody storytelling. It leaves a body count, along with an emotional mark. Quite honestly, it's a thrill to see a mid-budget thriller crafted along such mature, unflashy lines. ""Sicario: Day of the Soldado"" is less a political film and much more a straightforward action movie. The adrenaline is undeniable, and even when things get a little sketchy, there's always Del Toro. This movie is just so piercingly disturbing and riveting. The follow-up to the 2016 feds-versus-cartels thriller is not in the same league as the Denis Villeneuve original. But Brolin and Del Toro keep the action strong and stinging until the sequel crosses the line into Trump-style fearmongering. Benicio del Toro is the Ernest Hemingway of screen badasses: the less he says the better he is. He does his most convincing work while looking like he's about to nod off.

""Day of the Soldado"" is at its best when it sticks to its own raw brand of truth. As if in imitation of the ruthless Mexican drug cartel its heroes go after, director Stefano Sollima's sequel decapitates, disembowels, and castrates Denis Villeneuve's beautiful, tough, and sad 2015 original. There are moments that are quite tense, but as a whole, ideologically, I don't know what this movie is trying to say--I don't know that its that coherent. The carnage in Day of the Soldado becomes numbing to such a degree that it's hard to care about what happens next.

The silliness of Moore's oeuvre is so self-evident that being able to spot it is a basic intelligence test, like the ability to match square peg with square hole. Sicko, which takes on America's profoundly profitable and catastrophically inefficient health care system, is Moore's most assured, least antagonistic and potentially most important film.

At the very least, he's raised a warning flag that shouldn't be ignored. Mr. Moore has hardly been shy about sharing his political beliefs, but he has never before made a film that stated his bedrock ideological principles so clearly and accessibly. It is quintessential Moore: expertly crafted, eminently entertaining, one-sided and overly simplistic. What's most striking about Sicko is how composed, even serene it is compared with Michael Moore's previous acts of cinematic insurgency.

Why give Moore a free pass just because you support his ideologies? In the end, the real loyalty we owe is to truth. Whatever anyone's feelings may be about Michael Moore, it's hard to disagree with his argument that health care in the United States is broken and needs to be fixed. Why give Moore a free pass just because you support his ideologies? In the end, the real loyalty we owe is to truth. Whatever anyone's feelings may be about Michael Moore, it's hard to disagree with his argument that health care in the United States is broken and needs to be fixed. It works very well. Moore winds up treating the audience the same way that, he says, powerful people treat the weak in America -- as dopes easily satisfied with fairy tales and bland reassurances. Sicko is Moore's best film: a documentary that mixes outrage, hope, and gonzo stunts in the right proportions; and that throws an unforgiving spotlight on what is, in both senses, the elephant in the room.

Sicko is Moore's best film: a documentary that mixes outrage, hope, and gonzo stunts in the right proportions; and that throws an unforgiving spotlight on what is, in both senses, the elephant in the room. Lots of Sicko stands as boffo political theater, but its major domo lost me by losing his sense of humor. We Americans inevitably feel we know the best way to do everything, but the great accomplishment of Sicko is that it is difficult to watch this slyly confrontational film and remain sure. Sicko, the professional provocateur's most accomplished and fervent film, is what the movie doc prescribes for temporary relief from the chronic headache that is the American health-care system. The film is an alternately depressing and uplifting experience, a documentary whose ironies -- taking sick Americans to Cuba for cheaper, better health care -- won't be lost on anybody. It may incite lawmakers in a position to help to trumpet their faux proletarian credentials. This is essential viewing -- informative, corrosive, and even sometimes hilarious. A better, more focused effort than Fahrenheit 9/11 or Bowling for Columbine. A compelling, tear-jerking look at a vital piece of our infrastructure gone awry. Sicko represents Moore's most mature work as a filmmaker. Sicko, an investigation and indictment of a system choking on paperwork, greed, bad policy and countervailing goals, turns out to be a fuzzy, toothless collection of anecdotes, a few stunts and a bromide-rich conclusion. Here's an issue that transcends politics and speaks to basic human need and collective responsibility; perhaps we need Moore's cudgel to make the case bluntly.

Here's an issue that transcends politics and speaks to basic human need and collective responsibility; perhaps we need Moore's cudgel to make the case bluntly. Sicko is worth seeing -- as long as the big grain of salt needed for it is put on more than just the popcorn. Even Moore's worst ideological enemies would be hard put to dispute the basic argument of his new film Sicko: The American health-care system is a sick joke and has been for a very long time. Moore has finally made a moving, whimsical, infuriating film that won't just infuriate the right-wingers who've made a cottage industry out of hating him nor sing to the liberal choir who supports even his shadiest arguments. Sicko will scare people, and it probably should. ""Who are we?"" might be a better (if less jazzy) title for Sicko, Michael Moore's two-hour meditation on the sickly qualities of American health care. Moore may play loose with the facts, but you don't have to believe every frame in the movie to come away thinking that the message in Sicko is not only worthwhile, it is also inarguable. Michael Moore's latest documentary-as-soapbox-vituperation is a damning, touching, darkly comical exposé on the United States health-care system. It's doubtful even Michael Moore would claim Sicko as the last word on the subject. But it is a first word -- a very loud first word -- and while it may have been said better, at least Moore said it. Moore could open a lot of eyes with Sicko but as the song says, we don't need another hero, especially one self-proclaimed. Sicko is a teaspoonful of documentary sugar in a summer of popcorn salt. Raise your hand if you've had any Kafka-like health insurance dilemmas. Yes, that's a lot of hands. And as it turns out, at least one has been severed. Moore's films usually make conservatives angry. This one is likely to strike home with anyone, left or right, who has had serious illness in the family. Sicko is Moore's best, most focused movie to date -- much more persuasive than the enraged and self-righteous Fahrenheit 9/11. Michael Moore takes aim at his easiest target to date, and no doubt the hit he scores will become a hit. It's not impossible that this bitterly funny, bitterly sad call to alms could move reform back up the political agenda. For that reason alone, you owe it to yourself to see this movie.

Moore has again made a film which, though basically sound in logic, sugars the pill in a way which seems suspect in its determination to suggest that, as far as healthcare is concerned, America is bad and everywhere else is good. A devastating exposure of America's iniquitous healthcare system, coolly marshalled and amusingly detailed by Moore. Moore is rightly celebrated for his elaborately staged stunts and this film's highlight, involving a boat-trip to Cuba, is as hilarious as it is disturbing.

It's a gripping, maddening and thoroughly satisfying thriller, made with artfulness and integrity. If this does prove to be Soderbergh's final film - and I wouldn't hold my breath - he picked a heck of a one to go out on. Like a gel cap in a sip of orange juice, the psycho-pharmacological thriller Side Effects goes down easily, even if its long-term impact turns out to be barely discernible. The movie descends into a TV-grade police procedural, with twists so sharp and a plot so convoluted you may need meds to clear your head. Side Effects was shot on digital video that makes it look as if we're peering through dirty glass, but it's still a lavishly dread-fueled suspense movie full of twists, reversals, double crosses, and dangerous liaisons. The film as a whole is consistently enjoyable and sometimes thrilling, a classic Soderbergh showcase for provocative storytelling and marvelous acting. The movie maintains its sense of style throughout, but that hardly matters as the story just gets stupider and stupider. Sex, lies, and violence. ""Side Effects"" has the sleek, chic look of a Soderbergh film -- cool colors, seductive lighting -- but the script, by frequent collaborator Scott Z. Burns, is disappointingly clunky. A pill-popping drama that suddenly turns into something entirely different. Soderbergh, in what's rumored to be his final theatrical release (don't believe it), jumps from imitating the master to imitating the master imitators. The fun of ""Side Effects"" lies in figuring out what sort of movie it is even as you're watching it. Stop reading now, avoid all reviews and blabbermouths, and go see the movie yourself before anyone tells you anything. The movie respects a viewer's intelligence, which should also serve as a warning; don't be lulled into a stupor. Keeping sharp will allow all the fun and menace in this terrific thriller to seep into your head. If this is indeed Soderbergh's final theatrical film, as the director has said he's going into semi-retirement, it's not such a bad way to go out. A doozy of a Hitchcockian thriller with Jude Law, Rooney Mara and Catherine Zeta-Jones, Effects is a go-for-broke valentine to '80s cinematic psychological potboilers. This neatly executed mystery is just the sort of thing Hollywood craves from Steven Soderbergh: genre entertainment as cool, clean, and impersonal as a Formica countertop. The director who came into the field with Sex, Lies, and Videotape leaves it with sex and lies shot on video, still surprising us with both the stories he tells and the stories hidden inside them. Provides a minor but distinct kind of cinematic pleasure: the joy of sitting back and letting a master manipulator mess with your head. While the plot may be predictable (and more than a little preposterous) in retrospect, Mr. Soderbergh handles it brilliantly, serving notice once again that he is a crackerjack genre technician. ""Side Effects"" goes to unexpected places, and we breathlessly follow along. It's the kind of thriller that Alfred Hitchcock might make if he was still alive and active today. Burns' plotting gets a little knotty in the third act, but he's a smart writer, who has a knack for juggling an array of characters of varying intelligence and varying corruption levels. Of the many twists and turns in Steven Soderbergh's vastly entertaining thriller Side Effects, the most gratifying has less to do with the nimble plotting than the fact that it isn't the type of movie it initially appears to be. Soderbergh came, he saw, he conquered, and now he's moving on. It's a gripping, maddening and thoroughly satisfying thriller, made with artfulness and integrity. If this does prove to be Soderbergh's final film - and I wouldn't hold my breath - he picked a heck of a one to go out on. Like a gel cap in a sip of orange juice, the psycho-pharmacological thriller Side Effects goes down easily, even if its long-term impact turns out to be barely discernible. The movie descends into a TV-grade police procedural, with twists so sharp and a plot so convoluted you may need meds to clear your head. Side Effects was shot on digital video that makes it look as if we're peering through dirty glass, but it's still a lavishly dread-fueled suspense movie full of twists, reversals, double crosses, and dangerous liaisons. The film as a whole is consistently enjoyable and sometimes thrilling, a classic Soderbergh showcase for provocative storytelling and marvelous acting. The movie maintains its sense of style throughout, but that hardly matters as the story just gets stupider and stupider. Sex, lies, and violence.

Side Effects virtually demands a three-word review: Just see it. The main thing to keep in mind while watching Steven Soderbergh's playful new thriller is not to take the movie too seriously or else you'll feel betrayed by the end. Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Z. Burns maintain a tone of taut creepiness, but the plot's double and triple crosses are more ingenious than believable. ""Side Effects"" does a nice job teasing current anxieties about depression, medical ethics and class striving with the classic thriller quandary of ""Who's playing whom?""

A stylish take on the psychiatric-thriller genre that, despite progressive narrative absurdities, mostly delivers a dose to the pleasure centres. In some ways the film is more traditional than you think it will be, becoming a psychological puzzle piece. But Soderbergh lays the puzzle out so neatly, you can't help but be engrossed.

""Playbook"" walks a tightrope in how it portrays mental illness -- deriving humor out of its characters' actions while demonstrating just how deep-rooted their problems are. It's a strain to care about Pat, and it's impossible to believe in his world. Silver Linings is consistently entertaining, with its scrappy, well-drawn characters, offbeat humor and indefatigable positive outlook. The movie doesn't break any thematic ground, and in other hands this same material might have made for an insufferable Katherine Heigl vehicle. But Russell and his cast make it sing - and soar, too. Dramatic, emotional, even heartbreaking, as well as wickedly funny, it has the gift of going its own way, a complete success from a singular talent. Cooper's performance meets Lawrence's, beautifully, halfway. Everything comes together brilliantly in ""Silver Linings Playbook""-for the film's crazed but uncrazy lovers; for the filmmaker, David O.

I loved her in Winter's Bone and The Hunger Games but she's very young - I didn't think she had this kind of deep-toned, layered weirdness in her. David O. Russell returns to his distinctive brand of neurotic screwball comedy, and like his early features Spanking the Monkey and Flirting With Disaster, this one somersaults giddily from sanity to insanity to sanity again. 'Silver Linings Playbook' is fun, sharp and sometimes moving, but it's not reinventing any kind of wheel. A determinedly offbeat romance and rather knowing portrait of self-destructive behavior. Because of Lawrence, I just can't write off this movie. Would that every feel-good movie came by its good feelings so honestly. With Silver Linings Playbook, David O.

Skyfall can take its place alongside From Russia with Love, Goldfinger, and On Her Majesty's Secret Service as the best Bond can offer. Mendes and Deakins are so busy trying to be visionary that they don't notice that characters are wandering too far from their roots, and half the time you can't see what's going on.

Whether Mr. Mendes is deploying an explosion or a delectable detail, he retains a crucially human scale and intimacy, largely by foregrounding the performers. Bond is back, and so is high-octane entertainment. I'm happy to report that Bond is back, and he's bad. And that's good. The stripped-down, slightly grittier feel of the movie carries us along - and, perhaps, even announces a direction for the series that's both new to young fans and as old as ""From Russia With Love."" The 23rd official Bond seems as fresh as the first, incorporating tradition with innovation in gratifying ways. This is perhaps the most visually stunning Bond movie ever made. The movie makes a claim that can't be matched by many Bond films: It's actually about something. Skyfall's fatal misstep is its slavish hewing to event-movie trends. In ""Skyfall,"" Mendes has given us a thrilling new chapter in a franchise that by all rights should have been gasping for air - which really makes him the hero of this saga. If, on paper, this sounds like business as usual for 007, Skyfall feels like anything but. Whether Mr. Mendes is deploying an explosion or a delectable detail, he retains a crucially human scale and intimacy, largely by foregrounding the performers.

The 23rd official Bond seems as fresh as the first, incorporating tradition with innovation in gratifying ways. ""Skyfall"" is a different kind of Bond movie, one that works just fine on its own terms, but a steady diet of this might kill the franchise. One ""Skyfall"" is enough. Great heroes are often enhanced by the villains they face, and such is the situation here. To really work, Bond needs great bad guys. Silva is bad at its best. Skyfall leaves you wondering whether this incarnation of the character has anywhere left to go. It's the portrait of a spy at the end of his rope by an actor who seems close to his. The movie's smartest suit is emotional intelligence: Skyfall keeps us caring, intensely, for a hero who, by any rational measure, is a vestige of a vanished era. This is the movie in which the newest Bond finally eases into the part of the bon vivant for-Queen-and-Country horndog who likes his martinis shaken and not stirred. The director, Sam Mendes, has taken a pop concept and solemnized it with Freud, which is not, perhaps, the best way of turning Bond into grownup entertainment. Craig has settled into a well-suited, grim-reaper role. Even when James flirts and trysts, his creased face suggests an unmovable weight. Daniel Craig, in his third outing as 007, has taken over the role in a way that makes it his as distinctively as it was Sean Connery's all those years ago. What a difference 50 years makes. It might sound blasphemous, but in Skyfall Daniel Craig has it all over previous 007s. There's a gritty, real-world feel to Skyfall that makes good use of Craig's down-to-earthiness. This is a smashing entertainment, but also one that feels over-engineered and constrained by its origins. While ""Skyfall"" obviously has a great fondness for the past, it's not trapped there. It also anticipates Bond's future. In this immensely satisfying movie, so do we. Skyfall is certainly the most cultured Bond film to come along in some time. It's also the first of the three Craig endeavors to seriously (and wittily) acknowledge its pedigree. The James Bond franchise turns 50 with a stellar entry that fires on all cylinders as an action picture but also casts a modest glance backward to its illustrious past. This is Bond like you've never seen him and a dynamite Daniel Craig, never better in the role, nails Bond's ferocity and feeling. Skyfall is smashing, just smashing. With spectacular action sequences, a rock-solid star and a ration of cheese that's good English cheddar, ""Skyfall"" is a gift from above. From the first smoky notes of a theme song sung by Adele, it's clear that ""Skyfall"" will be both classic and of-the-moment. Skyfall doesn't forget it has to be an exciting spy film above all, but from its first scene, it ratchets up the drama in ways that have little to do with action. This is a full-blooded, joyous, intelligent celebration of a beloved cultural icon, with Daniel Craig taking full possession of a role he previously played unconvincingly.

Mendes' approach to action is classical and elegant - no manic editing and blurry unintelligible images here - but what makes the movie special is the attention he pays his actors.

Four stars simply aren't enough for Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire, which just may be the most entertaining movie I've ever labeled a masterpiece in these pages. It's fair to say that the movie ends so well that it will redeem the entire experience for many viewers. It all depends on how you feel about the sluggish 90 minutes that went before. When Boyle pulls back to show us his grand vision, it's a stunner. And everything suddenly falls into place, as if this uncommonly daring film was fated to work from the very start.

It turns into a clangy medieval epic, full of random woodland monsters and battles, and it begins to lose the pulse of its fairy-tale mystique. It's like watching Clash of the Titans IV: Revenge of the Blood Apple. I resisted this derivative mishmash of classic fairytale and modern epic fantasy for as long as I could, but ultimately it swept me up into its geeky but manly embrace and carried me away on a white charger. After a while, you just sit back and let the thing wash over you, marveling and giggling as necessary. ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" never quite delivers on its promise -- a dark retelling of the fairy tale in which women hold the true power, good and evil -- but it certainly is an attractive misfire. Snow does earn top billing, but don't be fooled: This film belongs to the Oscar-winning Theron, who sinks her talons into the killer part, making every snarl and outburst such wicked, cruel fun to behold. This slightly overstuffed entertainment rises, in part thanks to [Hemsworth], to one of the most pleasant surprises of the summer movie season so far. Astonishingly beautiful and breathtaking in its brutal imagery, Snow White & the Huntsman is thrilling and frightening in equal measure, yet as bereft of satisfying substance as a poisoned apple. We're supposed to believe that Snow White commands the adoration of everyone she meets, but when poor Hemsworth lunges in for his emotional reveal, it's as plausible as a man professing undying love for a tablespoon.

There will be lots of versions of Theron's evil queen running around West Hollywood this Halloween; it's a performance that's one part Tilda Swinton to 30 parts Faye Dunaway, the sort of over-the-top craziness that spawns midnight screenings. A slow, boring film that has no charm and is highlighted only by a handful of special effects and Charlize Theron's truly evil queen. Stunningly shot and inconsistently acted and written, Snow White has enough visual fireworks to keep the film afloat, even if star Kristen Stewart can't get out of Twilight mode. It is an absolute wonder to watch and creates a warrior princess for the ages. But what this revisionist fairy tale does not give us is a passionate love - its kisses are as chaste as the snow is white. The director sets a heart-pounding pace, pausing only for such interludes as Snow White's encounter with seven dwarfs who could not be more distant from their Disney forebears. Tangled and overblown. What dooms Snow White and the Huntsman is ultimately not how over the top it is, but how dull it is. Snow White and the Huntsman has a darkness that seeps into the soul - but it's also definitely a missed opportunity. Director Rupert Sanders loses his nerve just when the story starts cooking. A surprisingly fine, fantastic movie it is. Rare among the recent fairy tale adaptions (from Mirror Mirror to the dreadful Red Riding Hood) the invigorating Snow White and the Huntsman actually breathes new life into an old story. Sanders makes all the mistakes of a neophyte filmmaker, but doing it with such a massive budget leads to a cinematic hodgepodge of fractured fairy-tale imagery, computer-generated menacing forests and gamboling, turtle-riding fairies. There is something exciting about how seriously ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" takes its themes. This over-crammed, disjointed, and lugubrious film is misconceived from the ground up. Hollywood's fairy tale fad reaches its nadir with this listless, witless, bum-numbing adventure-whimsy... The only one who comes out of this odd pairing unscathed is Walt Disney, looking smarter than ever for boiling the tale down to its mythical essence way back in 1937. Handsome but hollow. At its best, ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" feels less like a desperate blockbuster and more like a handmade object. [It] all feels like serious, pay-attention-now, schoolroom stuff - Shakespeare without the poetry, ""Braveheart"" without the performances. When Snow rides into battle wielding a sword, you want to tell her to put that thing down before she pokes her eye out. A bold rethinking of a familiar old story and striking design elements are undercut by a draggy mid-section and undeveloped characters in Snow White and the Huntsman. This ""Snow White"" is one of those revisionist fairy tales in which the princess takes control of her own destiny. A different actress might have been able to sell that, but Stewart can't...

Huntsman feints at being the Snow White retelling no one has ever seen before, but ultimately becomes the ""been there, done that"" of fairy-tale filmmaking. ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" reinvents the legendary story in a film of astonishing beauty and imagination. As far as live-action reimaginings of fairy tales are concerned, this is one of the more inventive ones and is unquestionably better than 2011's Red Riding Hood misfire. Vastly superior to Mirror, Mirror in every way. Great work from Charlize Theron. Sanders does not (yet) share Guillermo del Toro's gifts, but he, too, has an eye for the beautiful and the grotesque, and for that entrancing borderline where the two meet. Only Bob Hoskins as the blind seer Muir comes close to making us care. We can almost glean Snow White's heroic possibilities through his clouded eyes. As much as we'd like to, we certainly can't from Stewart's efforts. Some of the fairy tale effects are marvelous; but the odyssey from darkness to light is unduly long and sloggy, and Stewart, with her contemporary edge, seems to be acting in the wrong era. ""Snow White and the Huntsman,"" a solemn but mostly savvy rewrite, is a welcome upgrade. A virtual orchard of toxic excess, starting with the unnecessarily sprawling cast of characters. There are many splendid reasons to see Snow White and the Huntsman - enough, maybe, not to care that neither Snow White nor the Huntsman rank high among them. Fails to realize the full potential of its ambitiously dark vision. Is this movie trying to be ""Excalibur"" or ""My Little Pony""? Perhaps the best thing about ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is it doesn't smirk at itself. It plays out as a story about mortality and greed and oppression in a fantastical world, but it doesn't act as if anything is silly.

It's clearly told, energetically made, fast-edited and propulsive: topical popular history. Stone made the very smart move to hire a committed, underrated actor to play the challenging lead role, and the result is a film that thrives off its central performance. The production values are first-rate - Stone's movies are always very good-looking - and the finely shaded performance of Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the lead role is a revelation.

With well-made movies such as ""Snowden,"" though, his skill as a filmmaker becomes much harder for the detractors to debate. Stone seems genuinely interested in the slow and steady process by which Edward Snowden came to distrust the government that he worked for, and the director has made a slow and steady movie to go with it. More hagiography than biography, Stone's film portrays Snowden as a candidate for sainthood whose only flaw is that he cares too much.

More hagiography than biography, Stone's film portrays Snowden as a candidate for sainthood whose only flaw is that he cares too much. Stone still evinces his old, hand-rubbing glee in exposing the vermin hiding under the rock marked National Security, and there are some fine scenes... but there's a slickness, and also a slackness, to the proceedings. Snowden could have been an important film. It certainly contains important elements. Sadly, unlike its subject, it's unremarkable and easily forgotten. While the drama here is straight forward and conventional, Stone turns a brilliant trick by visually showing how computer spying is conducted. We do not have to understand how it works to appreciate what it does -- because Stone skillfully shows us. Snowden should be frothing at the mouth. Instead, the best it can work up is a weary sigh. If Laura Poitras' Oscar-winning documentary ""Citizenfour"" was the technical, unflinching, non-fiction version of Edward Snowden's explosive NSA leaks, Stone's film is most definitely the Hollywood version. It never feels tedious, thanks to Stone's tremendous sense of story construction, the film's razor-sharp editing - and Gordon-Levitt's masterful performance. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is fiercely committed as Snowden, but director Oliver Stone sticks to the surface and buries the provocation. ""Snowden"" is worth watching for the ideas and arguments it inspires, and for the layers of a still-mysterious character it reveals. [Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivers] an interestingly inward performance. Outwardly, however, there's almost no suspense, which, given the narrative possibilities, is a remarkably dubious achievement. Snowden isn't a liberal screed, or at least not an overt one. It's a sincere, straightforward biopic that, at its worst, verges on hagiography. ""Snowden"" could have been a character portrait, but instead it's like ""The Bourne Identity"" - the chases and fights, which is like a ham and cheese sandwich - the ham and cheese. Credit Joseph Gordon-Levitt -- first, for even playing Snowden, and also for attempting to mimic Snowden's unique cadence as well as his physical appearance. Joseph Gordon-Levitt sympathetically portrays the bespectacled title cipher, a Rubik's Cube champ with an IBM brain. Mr. Stone has made an honorable and absorbing contribution to the imaginative record of our confusing times. Gordon-Levitt turns in an Oscar-worthy performance as a man who's all too aware of what he's letting himself in for. And Woodley skillfully balances a range of emotions as Lindsay. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is good as Snowden (his voice alone is terrific), capturing his nerdy intelligence and passion for patriotism. Shailene Woodley is even better as Lindsay Mills, Snowden's girlfriend. Snowden's a polarizing whistleblower portrayed as an American hero here but in too pedestrian a fashion for such a hot-button topic, and the movie seems at times as awkward as its brainiac subject. Stone used to be fearless in both the stories he told and the way he told them: Now, it seems, he's just the former. Stone always gets good work out of his leads. They're interesting opposites too, here, in both part and performance: Joseph Gordon-Levitt, minimalist and withholding, as Snowden, and Shailene Woodley, jangling and emotional, as Lindsay. A sympathetic but subtle portrayal of a young whistleblower who broke the law and paid a price. It's well and compellingly made, working hard to bring the blurry figure of Snowden into focus while dramatizing his transformation from patriotic civil servant to appalled citizen whistle-blower. Even though this is Stone's most interesting work since the underrated ""W."" nearly a decade ago, it's not all that much. A duly serious and ambitious fall movie that, despite the best efforts of its formidable director and cast, can't remotely match the excitement of real life. There's a deeper emptiness at the core of the movie, a failure of nerve and a fundamental incuriosity about what makes the Snowden affair interesting and relevant, then and now.

The truth, I daresay, is exactly the opposite. No doubt Harrison Ford's Han Solo would casually dismiss this adequately fun origin story with a wink and a wry smile.

Strip away the nostalgia, the familiar Star Wars backdrop and take it for what it's worth, and ""Solo"" is a bit of a clunker. Best of all, the movie is different. It's checklist mythology, but thankfully served up with enough panache to make the trip engaging. No light sabres are on display and nor is there any sign of Darth Vader but Solo: A Star Wars delivers exactly what you want and expect from a movie about the young Han Solo.

I don't know if Beethoven and a sympathetic newspaper reporter can redeem a messy American city, but this movie makes a plausible case for so fervent a dream. The movie is a noble enterprise, and Downey is stupendous as usual, but Joe Wright's direction is too slick to elicit much feeling. Wright has Jamie Foxx and Robert Downey Jr., both outstanding. Their performances make up for the meandering plot and occasional missteps; neither actor is ever anything less than compelling, giving The Soloist an emotional heft it might not have enjoyed. It's marvelous work all around, especially by Foxx and Downey. Their duet makes The Soloist sing. The Soloist takes all those innately engaging details and turns them into what is essentially a made-for-Lifetime movie, albeit one populated by Oscar winners and nominees. Foxx and Downey's disciplined duet come close to redeeming The Soloist from its visual excesses. The Soloist is a moving, inspirational story told in a straightforward style, refreshingly devoid of sentimentality.

Mr Downey and Mr. Foxx both turn in Oscar-worthy performances in their very strenuous and detail-drenched roles. The Soloist is like its two protagonists: It's a little messy and beaten up in spots, but ultimately it's decent and dignified. In the end, The Soloist isn't about BIG MOMENTS, it's about the grace notes, the kind that stay with you. A workaholic roused to life by his contact with an extraordinary person. Music healing all ills. The rehabilitation of an impaired genius. The only reason any of this is barely watchable is because of the stars. Tough-minded yet often touching, The Soloist works precisely because it doesn't go where we think it's going to go. The movie, for all its flaws, reminds us that everyone is worth catching, but it's the actors who best embody that message. They go the full human being. The tone of The Soloist is wildly uneven. Though unsparing and unsentimental when framing the principals, Wright is hyperbolic when depicting the agitation of the mentally ill and the soothing rapture of music. Strangely, the inspirational power of The Soloist lies not in its music but in the heart and soul of its intriguing characters. The movie avoids most of the pitfalls: Its epiphanies are small ones, but with the gleam of truth. As Ayers, a Juilliard-trained cellist reduced to homelessness, Foxx turns The Soloist from a mildly effective inspirational tale into an aggressive awards-season advertisement. The Soloist has all the elements of an uplifting drama, except for the uplift. The story is compelling, the actors are in place, but I was never sure what the filmmakers wanted me to feel about it. This film version takes a somewhat romanticized view of both journalism and skid row yet is nevertheless a compassionate and compelling look at mental illness.

I wish The Soloist had done more than pay lip service to this subject, but the traces of what might have been are still resonant. A failed and problematic Oscar hopeful being dumped in theaters a week before the start of Hollywood's summer season. The movie still entertains -- thanks to Downey's staccato rhythms and Foxx's secret melodies. But it remains flawed. Backed by his newfound A-list stardom, Downey brings to the project a wry swagger -- crucial in an essentially reactive role. I wish, though, that ""The Soloist"" hadn't spent so much time dealing with Lopez's crises of conscience and career, even as they r It took guts. And I suspect there's no sense in making a cautious film about Nathaniel Ayers. It's a journey full of good intentions, but also some dubious decisions. Mr. Wright and his colleagues have made a movie with a spaciousness of its own, a brave willingness to explore such mysteries of the mind and heart as the torture that madness can inflict, and the rapture that music can confer. Bravo to all concerned. In the end, The Soloist is about how unknowable other people really are -- an idea that's terrifying until you step back and see the wonder of it. The Soloist foregoes easy solutions, and even more importantly, it foregoes any easy sense of friendship. Perceptive [and] deeply engaging. While the film is unable to resolve its central subject, its background portrayal of the ongoing dissolution of the newspaper industry -- captured in a few fleeting images of layoffs and downsizing -- is vividly realized. For all its sensitivity to the horrors of mental illness, The Soloist ends up as a fairly canned piece of work. A deeply empathetic exploration of mental illness and a winning showcase for the talents of its two stars, Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Foxx. A movie about an improbable friendship set against the backdrop of urban and cultural decay, The Soloist strives for deep meaning and settles for gritty reality. [Director Joe Wright's] treatment of the material is so literal that at times the film seems like a syllabus for Remedial Cinematic Technique 101. While the narrative occasionally falters, The Soloist wisely avoids the pitfalls of the inspirational biopic by not tidily sewing things up. Instead, it presents a moving tribute to friendship and the power of music. Hollywood loves the heroics of good intentions, but this is that rare movie that is just as interested in the road to hell.

Good movies summon up worlds. ""Son of Saul"" [is] a great movie ... No matter how many Holocaust films you've seen, you've not seen one like this. ""Son of Saul"" is a work of superlative filmmaking craft and moral intensity. Son Of Saul, for all the enormity of its subject matter, is an oddly gripping experience-a vision of intense purpose found in what may be the final hours of a life. It's also a pretty stunning formal accomplishment ... It's not an easy sit, but it is a riveting, effective one. [A] tense, harsh, and superlative Hungarian drama [with a] compellingly ambiguous script. Right away, we know we're in the hands of a director who wants to tell the story of the Holocaust from a different perspective than we've seen before in films: a more personal, intimate one. A Hungarian masterwork from first-time director László Nemes. You don't merely witness horror, you feel it in your bones. If the direction at times seems a little restrained, a little formalist - how else do you tell this story? What other choice do you have apart from simply giving one long, raw scream?

Finally, a cinematic genre heretofore mired in pietistic melodrama and safe aesthetic distance has been blown open and virtually reinvented, even the well-known contours of its subject matter reinvested with urgency, meaning and mournful honesty. The opening sequence achieves the outer limits of film art. Movies simply don't get more powerful than this. For all its intensity, Son of Saul is never ponderous. It moves so quickly, and relies so little on dialogue, that you need to race a little to keep up with it, and to keep your eyes open every second. A Holocaust drama like you have never seen before.

Riley dramatizes outrageously complex machinations of predatory greed and depraved misrule-and offers a passionate, joyous vision of resistance. The most hair-raising comedy of the year, or else the most side-splitting horror movie. While it doesn't always work, Riley has clearly held nothing back and after 25+ years of using his voice and unique point of view in the world of hip-hop, this is as audacious an entry into the world of feature filmmaking as one could possibly make. Like the delectable dietary debauchery of a bloomin' onion, the film is coated in layers of different flavors that combine together for an incredible taste-until you remember how sickeningly bad it all is for you. Sorry To Bother You is often wildly funny, and if its broad arc is familiar stuff about a down-on-his-luck everyman experiencing success but at what cost, at least the plot specifics are unpredictable by dint of Riley's imagination.

Rapper Boots Riley scores a knockout directing debut with this no-mercy satire, starring a breakout Lakeith Stanfield, that gets all up in your face about race and the media. Summer has found its real fireworks right here. If you dig the handmade surrealism of Spike Jonze and Michel Gondry or the antiestablishment weirdness of Repo Man, then this one is undoubtedly for you. Riley shrewdly balances the serious and the comic in a timely film that manages to be both fierce and hugely entertaining. Once Cassius starts using his very Caucasian vocals, he becomes the office wunderkind. It works fine as an outrageous comedy, but the perceptive commentary will likely give it staying power. This is the fearless satire that America desperately needs right now.

Sorry to Bother You takes too long to get to a payoff that's impressively brash but too surreal to function as satire. Yet tightening and focusing the movie's script probably wouldn't have helped.

Gathers up an eclectic range of influences... and pushes them rambunctiously forward, into a genre that might be described as intersectional screwball science fiction. The film's barbs about racism, capitalism, slavery, and cultural appropriation are so purposefully scattershot that the fact that none of it really hangs together is likely viewed as a badge of honor.

Part of the fun of Duncan Jones's frequently clever sci-fi thriller is being as in-the-dark as the film's protagonist.

There's just enough pop physics, and more than enough real human psychology, to lend this intriguing popcorn movie some depth.

It's a fun game for a while: the conceit has the vertiginous appeal of a good Quantum Leap episode (right down to another face gazing back at Jake in the mirror). The script by Ben Ripley doesn't come up with enough obstacles to throw in the hero's path, and his budding romance with the doomed Christina feels more like a studio mandate than an organic development.

A smart sci-fi thriller that maybe asks a bit more of its audience than the average movie. But the payoff is solid, and really -- how long is eight minutes? Duncan Jones' swiftly paced and engaging sci-fi thriller is a Groundhog Day for a post- 9/11 world.

The problem with ""Source Code"" is the idea of ""Source Code."" Director Jones and screenwriter Ben Ripley also deserve credit for expertly shuffling the plot. Source Code, written by Ben Ripley, is directed by Duncan Jones, who ran similar rings around consciousness in his acclaimed debut, Moon. The great gimmick of this new film is its license to thrill. The differences each time the eight minutes come around are surprisingly absorbing and there's a pleasing Hitchcockian jokiness at work. The first film in a while to have a decent heart while quickening your pulse. Putting across a premise as fantastical as this film's requires top-flight acting, as well as a kind of poker face, and that's precisely what the movie delivers. A fun ride of a sci-fi thriller with terrific romantic chemistry between Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan. For the most part, ""Source Code"" delivers on its promises with precision and care - all that's missing is Punxsutawney Phil and a toast to world peace. This time, Jones has more money and greater studio expectations behind him, so what begins as another existential head trip that puts ideas before spectacle eventually morphs into something trite and compromised -- hard sci-fi gone soft. A smart sci-fi thriller that maybe asks a bit more of its audience than the average movie. But the payoff is solid, and really -- how long is eight minutes? Duncan Jones' swiftly paced and engaging sci-fi thriller is a Groundhog Day for a post- 9/11 world.

If you come to terms with the fact that Southpaw doesn't bring any ideas to the canvas that are any newer than Wallace Beery, this is an energetic enough fight picture to capture the imagination. Southpaw sticks to tried-and-tested genre rules, yet an edgy cast - led by formidable leading man Jake Gyllenhaal - keeps the story in sharp focus. The undeniable intensity of Gyllenhaal's bulked-up, Method-mumbling performance may leave you feeling more pummeled than convinced in this heavy-handed tale of redemption ... Southpaw is well made, but too conventional to skip the victorious ending or leave that kind of indelible impression. Gyllenhaal though? He's no lightweight. Moving effortlessly between big Hollywood movies and modest New York stage vehicles, [Gyllenhaal has] turned into quite an actor. Few stars make such concentrated efforts to improve their craft while rising through the ranks of stardom. Southpaw is an exhausting brutalist melodrama, but if nothing else, Fuqua always works with fine actors, and he's got a passel of them here. In bloody close-ups and bruising sounds, Fuqua captures the blinding brutality inside the ring. But his faith is never in question: This is a parable that believes strongest in boxing, itself. Gyllenhaal delivers a knockout performance as a disgraced boxer, but the movie doesn't fare so well. Compared to Gyllenhaal's fast, flinty turn in last year's Nightcrawler, this is simple stuff for him, suppressing the actor's natural craftiness into lugubrious Stallone-isms.

Southpaw doesn't try to reinvent the boxing-movie game - in fact, it pretty much indulges every cliche - but it's the intense central performance from a beefed up, ripped-to-the-core Jake Gyllenhaal that gives it distinction and heart. ""Southpaw"" goes beyond the specifics of boxing and becomes a universal story about tragedy and grief. This is a brow-beating, 123-minute-long boxing opus that brings absolutely nothing new to the ring. When boxing cliches work, they can deliver a knockout. When they don't, as in ""Southpaw,"" we get just punch-drunk.

The intense, raw acting skills of Gyllenhaal, and strong performances from Forest Whitaker and young actress Oona Laurence, save ""Southpaw"" from getting lost in its cliches. The film is set up like a straightforward redemption story, but what makes Southpaw interesting is the complexity of Hope's character -- thanks to Gyllenhaal's exceptional performance. Boxing movies tend to be exercises in masochism, machismo and redemptive melodrama. Southpaw hits all these targets square in the midriff. Jake Gyllenhaal looks the part. Bulked up and tracked with scars; leaking blood and woozily losing focus; lines slurred in a bleary method-acting mumble, he's wholly convincing as Billy Hope, the reigning light heavyweight champion of the world. ""Southpaw"" is proof of contrivance's clout, but there is a limit to what it can do. Gyllenhaal gives his all, but he can't make this one a winner. As for the in-the-ring bob, weave, clash, clutch? Well, those disappointed by May's impossibly hyped Mayweather-Pacquiao bout should enjoy the care director Fuqua takes in delivering the sweet science to the big screen. Southpaw asks both too much of Gyllenhaal and not enough - he's being forced to build a whole character out of scraps, sawdust, and horrendous clichés. Every plot turn is as telegraphed as a tomato can's jab. I didn't care: Enough of it felt earned to me that Southpaw wins on points. Call him ""Joltin' Jake"" Gyllenhaal, because the actor adds needed presence and punch to the melodrama of Southpaw. I wish I could say ""Southpaw"" was a knockout, or even a contender, that it went the distance or scored on points. But it's strictly an undercard bout, displaying enough heart and skill to keep the paying customers from getting too restless. What keeps this cornball business from getting out of hand is the commitment of Gyllenhaal, whose performance is fierce and muscular, in and out of the ring. You have to admire a fight picture in which the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat both arrive outside the ring. It's a win for Mr. Gyllenhaal, while the movie loses out to its clichés. This is a genre with especially sturdy bones, and when ""Southpaw"" connects, which is more often than you might expect, you feel it down to your toes. Although ""Southpaw"" has some punch, it's not exactly coming from left field. ""Southpaw"" is all about the fist. There's no delicate footwork here, no lingering grace notes. It's a film played entirely in power chords. This isn't great cinema, but it's satisfying movie-making, with nothing more on its mind than telling a heart-tugging story. Watchable in its first act but then increasingly dull and overwrought, fudging the idea of whether the audience should get behind its ""redemption-revenge"" motivation. ""Southpaw"" may be rote, predictable and mawkish, but none of those faults lie in its star. Even when he looks like an unholy mess, he transcends the movie he's in. The script may have hamburger for brains, but Fuqua slams it home with the help of actors who give their all - even when giving a little less might have made things more interesting. a retro, in-your-face fight drama that dribbles into sappiness. Much, though far from all, is redeemed by Gyllenhaal's virtuoso performance. All of Gyllenhaal's discipline and drive is misdirected; it's wasted energy, a cinematic rope-a-dope. It brings back every stale genre convention you can think of, then hopes you won't recognize predictability pumped up with swearing and steroids and an Eminem song during the training montage.

I veered between being awed and appalled, though mostly the latter. ""Southpaw"" is a tremendous accomplishment of mainstream cinematic craft, a near-perfect match of director, material and star. Perhaps overly keen to emulate his hero's turn in Raging Bull, Gyllenhaal puts too much faith in the idea that size matters. When you look past Fuqua's jittery directing, which dices up shots and leans the camera close into its star's painstakingly battered mug, Southpaw is a melange of familiar fighter movie ideas and images going back to Rocky. Just as director Antoine Fuqua starts to close in on something interesting and unexpected, he retreats to the safety of his corner and gives us what we've seen too many times before: a predictable flurry of melodramatic jabs. Even when we're aware our emotions are being manipulated, we're rooting hard for Billy Hope to beat the odds and climb the mountain, because have you seen how movie-adorable his daughter is? Don't they deserve some happiness? It's Gyllenhaal -- physically ferocious yet tenderly forlorn -- who sells the movie, putting both the beast and the heartbeat within on full display. The trouble with how hard Gyllenhaal goes in Southpaw is that he's in the service of weak material, so you notice the effort. Despite its supposedly hard-hitting veneer, the film never goes out on a limb when it counts. What this movie really is at heart is just a good-natured, perfectly decent, meat-and-potatoes palooka. In the end ""Southpaw"" knocks itself to the mat. Like a first-round knockout, Southpaw gets the job done, but it's all just a bit anticlimactic. The melodrama is uncomfortably high; the checked-box plot is manipulative. I veered between being awed and appalled, though mostly the latter.

Digging into Bond history, returning director Sam Mendes has, against all the odds, delivered a film that at least matches, and perhaps even betters, Skyfall. In pure action adventure terms, Spectre delivers the goods, with plenty of revved-up supercar porn and several kinetic high-speed chase sequences on road, river and snowy mountain slope. A wealth of iconography - both incidental and integral - from the series' founding chapters is revived here, making ""Spectre"" a particular treat for 007 nerds, and a businesslike blast for everyone else. No film series has been better at raiding its own mausoleum, and throughout Spectre, ghosts of Bond films past come gliding through the film, trailing shivers of pleasure in their wake. This fourth outing for Daniel Craig as James Bond is achingly cool, as sleek and powerful as the silver Aston Martin DB10 that races through the movie. A terrifically exciting, spectacular, almost operatically delirious 007 adventure. As an action movie, Spectre is every bit the equal of its predecessor, Skyfall. For at least half its running time, this is as good as Bond gets -- a rip-roaring and very stylishly made thriller with tremendous production values.

Like all of Craig's turns in the tux, Spectre is a blast of bespoke escapism, full of globetrotting action and thousand-thread-count opulence. Had it been the first Bond film with Craig in the title role, the reaction likely would be ""wow!"" This is some good stuff, way deeper than the silly Bonds. But with history behind us, it feels a little slight. For those who have been waiting patiently for Bond to stop brooding so heavily, Spectre is about as close as the Craig version of the character is probably going to get to the quipping, unflappable 007 of yore. [Mendes is] smart about pacing and rhythm and an astute judge of when to go for the joke and how to let his actors run the show, as opposed to the show -- the explosions and murders and such -- flattening the actors. A slick, beautifully photographed, action-packed, international thriller with a number of wonderfully, ludicrously entertaining set pieces, a sprinkling of dry wit, myriad gorgeous women and a classic psycho-villain.

The trouble with Spectre is that it's neither. All the expected ingredients are there...but they never distill into a whole greater than the sum of their predictable parts. Familiarity is not without its pleasures. But Spectre is so confused and inert that Craig can't even sell the signature ""Bond. James Bond"" and ""Shaken, not stirred"" lines. Whether Craig has another Bond chapter in him, or producers are ready to move on with another actor, one thing is clear: The 007 franchise is in a much better place than when Craig first appeared as Bond in 2006. Craig's expression is so unchanging it might as well be chiseled out of stone, and his emotionally uninvolved performance is similarly lacking in nuance. Though the rote installment is poised to rake at the box office, it won't leave you shaken or stirred. Craig continues his fine take on the legendary icon of books and movies. His Bond lacks the polish of Roger Moore's and Pierce Brosnan's versions, and for the better. Spectre is Craig's fourth Bond movie and his muscular tenure has been defined not just by his full embodiment of the character, but his overall stewardship. Spectre isn't quite as good as the more emotional Skyfall, but it's not far behind. Daniel Craig's stated goal was to make Spectre ""better than Skyfall."" Not quite, but it's still party time for Bond fans. Spectre wants to operate as both a grim post-9/11 thriller and a throwback spy yarn, and it succeeds often enough. There's something audacious about positing a massive security and civil liberties threat right in the heart of central government. One of the great satisfactions of ""Spectre"" is that, in addition to all the stirring action, and all the timely references to a secret organization ... we get to believe in Bond as a person.

The result is fun, even if it's a mishmash, leaving you shaken, not stirred. By the time Spectre reaches its conclusion, the backstory has become so fraught, the motives so unclear, and the layers of scheming by the villains so convoluted that it's exhausting. A gorgeous and dreamlike but ultimately frustrating Bond film. I blame Mendes. ""Spectre"" is a movie that wants to have fun but simply doesn't know how. It remains a decently robust and entertaining mid-level Bond movie - just one that's haunted by the specter of its predecessor. ""Spectre"" is full of not-good things, and some oppressively bad things that may come to feel like drill bits twirling in your skull. It's business as usual, even if that business is pulled off with brilliant precision, ingeniously choreographed action, and an itinerary boasting some of the most photogenic spots on Earth. This James Bond outing begins with a stunning set piece in which the hero, played by Daniel Craig, takes down a terrorist cell amid Day of the Dead festivities in Mexico City. A Bond movie is all about delivering on expectations: to enjoy it you have to be pleased rather than frustrated by its predictability. In that regard, Spectre... can be deemed a solid success ""Spectre"" isn't bad - just slightly disappointing. What pulls together the story's many tentacles is the unflappable Craig, a less-is-more actor who has evolved his Bond from the ""blunt instrument"" of Casino Royale into the ""good man"" of Spectre. Mendes, a cerebral director who balances action and erudition, lets us savor every conspiracy, chase and exotic locale. We don't expect a James Bond film to be deep, but at least we should be dazzled by the seductive gloss of its surfaces. Aside from that stunning opening sequence, this installment feels overcompensating and dutiful. We've seen it all before. Despite a plot trajectory that changes so often they seem to be making it up as they go along, everyone on and off the screen seems to be doing it by the numbers. In the end, this solid Bond does justice to the character's long legacy while paying due diligence to what he has become under Daniel Craig's stewardship. The result is fun, even if it's a mishmash, leaving you shaken, not stirred. By the time Spectre reaches its conclusion, the backstory has become so fraught, the motives so unclear, and the layers of scheming by the villains so convoluted that it's exhausting. A gorgeous and dreamlike but ultimately frustrating Bond film. I blame Mendes. ""Spectre"" is a movie that wants to have fun but simply doesn't know how. It remains a decently robust and entertaining mid-level Bond movie - just one that's haunted by the specter of its predecessor. ""Spectre"" is full of not-good things, and some oppressively bad things that may come to feel like drill bits twirling in your skull. It's business as usual, even if that business is pulled off with brilliant precision, ingeniously choreographed action, and an itinerary boasting some of the most photogenic spots on Earth. This James Bond outing begins with a stunning set piece in which the hero, played by Daniel Craig, takes down a terrorist cell amid Day of the Dead festivities in Mexico City. A Bond movie is all about delivering on expectations: to enjoy it you have to be pleased rather than frustrated by its predictability. In that regard, Spectre... can be deemed a solid success ""Spectre"" isn't bad - just slightly disappointing.

There are signs of Bond bloat within many of the action sequences - it must be hard to trim such extravagant footage - but they are at least partly overcome by an increase in levity. If one of the most successful and long-running franchises in movie history wants to keep pumping, it's once again time to change the formula. For the most part, it's efficient-enough Bond fare - overlong car chases, beautiful women in eternal danger, crazy stunts, suave cool under fire. Nice fitting suits.

Spectre is sloppier than other recent Bonds, but it also feels like it's exhausted the idea that fueled the franchise's relaunch -- darker and more realistic can only last so long when it's paired with a rotating cast of Bond girls and supervillains. I regard it as a ravishing exercise in near-despair, with Bond beset by the suspicion that, were he to desist, both his character and his cause would be unmasked as a void. Killing is his living, and his proof of life.

12471,m/spider_man_far_from_home,"A bouncy addition to a bulging franchise, with just enough fringe zaniness to help it stand out from the pack. ""Far From Home,"" for all its dazzle and speed, has simpler, humbler aspirations and fulfills them well enough. There's more suspense in Peter and MJ's awkward flirtation than there is in whether Spider-Man will emerge victorious, and that's exactly as it should be. If Spider-Man Far from Home is a triumph, as many will argue and its box office will undoubtedly confirm, it is a triumph of capitalism, not art. Spider-Man: Far From Home finds Tom Holland agreeably continuing as the most boyish Spidey yet, even as the film risks fan fury by spinning unfamiliar webs. It's mostly delightful; a fun movie that successfully hits the reset button for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I stan a pipsqueak. The story is pyrotechnical. The soundtrack is multi-decibel. There is no room for wit, thought, emotion or seriously challenging novelty. But, simultaneously, I'd rather watch Holland do this rubbish than most movie actors. In an impressively entertaining sequel, your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man saves the world -and rescues a summer movie season in the doldrums. Never feels like it's just biding its time between super-battles. If anything, and this is a compliment, the film frequently feels like a charming teen road-trip comedy that occasionally turns into a superhero movie. How's the new movie? It's good. It's fun. The movie has a bunch of winning performances from 22-year-olds still credibly playing 16, it tells a complete-ish yarn while dutifully laying track for further sequels, and it shows more visual brio than your average Marvel joint. I wound up liking Far From Home more than any Spider-Man film this decade. Tom Holland is still very winning as Spidey. The action, villainy, twists and overall logic fall short of its awesome predecessor. Spider-Man: Far From Home offers a breezy, Europe-set intermezzo between Avengers: Endgame and whatever is coming next - a kind of sorbet in blockbuster form to punctuate the binge. [D]irector Jon Watts' sequel isn't as tightly focused or effortlessly charming as 2017's ""Homecoming,"" yet it continues Holland's amazing Spidey run and introduces Jake Gyllenhaal in his top-notch first comic-book role. This second installment in the latest live-action Spider-Man reboot founders as it stomps through picturesque old cities in a series of ill-motivated and less-than-awesome action set-pieces. Watts... smoothly steers some of that heavy MCU world-building back into goofy high-school comedy, and his cast is so winning that the movie's interpersonal surprises are often more exciting than its big plot twists. An entertaining segue into the post-Avengers era. ""Far From Home"" gets closer, in spirit, to the good Tobey Maguire films. Almost aware of how thirsty it is, the new movie -- meta, irreverent and nowhere near a bad time -- works best when it plays like a vacation from seriousness.

But until all that nonsense gets rolling, Spider-Man: Far from Home is breezy and enjoyable, focusing on all that's most appealing about Peter Parker and his web-slinging alter ego Spider-Man. It goes from sunny pop to acid jazz, from ""Saved By the Bell"" to ""The Matrix."" Far From Home is a fun-filled romp that checks all the boxes of a Marvel movie and adds bits of humour and teenage angst that give it a frothy bit of sweetness that's hard not to love. Although he's the youngest Spider-Man, Holland has a classic farceur's energy and focus (he's a Brit, after all), and his Spider-Man is never a cartoon. ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" is a zesty and sweet and satisfying but not an overly dark slice of entertainment. The Feige formula, with its crafty blend of high-school comedy and top-of-the-range spectacle, overlaid with a jaunty, tongue-in-cheek tone, has worked. Everybody here hits the right note. An entertaining chapter in the life of a maturing Parker...Considering that this is a summer that birthed the woeful ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters, that ""Far From Home"" is more entertaining than a sequel has a right to be is miracle enough. The Spider-Man we find at the end of the movie is no different than the one we met at the start...you can't help but feel like he could have learned all of the same things without leaving Queens or wasting our time.

Spider-Man: Far From Home changes the scenery but can't quite match the inspired heights of its predecessor.

12472,m/spider_man_homecoming,"Spider-Man: Homecoming is both a homecoming for the character as well as a movie in which Spider-Man literally goes to homecoming-a fitting re-introduction and an endearingly goofy teen flick. The first Spidey flick as ebullient as the comics you read when you were a kid. What's particularly nice about this movie is what it doesn't have: too many bad guys, an overly complicated plot and a bunch of ridiculous fight scenes that are so needlessly complex you can't tell what's happening in them. That the movie comes off as loose and sweet and light on its feet as it does feels like sort of minor Marvel miracle. News Flash: Tom Holland is the best movie Spider-Man ever. He finds the kid inside the famous red onesie and brings out the kid in even the most hardened filmgoer. The magic of Homecoming is that it belongs more to the John Hughes cinematic universe than the Avengers'. A funny, sunny superhero movie for the whole family. You know what? Superhero cynicism aside, ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is really fun. Spider-Man: Homecoming is so joyously entertaining that it's enough to temporarily cure any superhero fatigue. There's wit, smarts and a nifty, inventive plot that serves as a reminder of what buoyant fun such films can bring. Hang in there, True Believers: Maybe it'll get better the second time around. Marvel has finally started to figure out what the future of superhero movies might look like. Feels a little more punchy, laugh-filled, and exciting than one might expect from a property that's already been given plenty of chances to succeed. The appeal of this particular Spider-Boy is all too basic: In his lunge for valor, he keeps falling, and he keeps getting up.

As long as the kids stay in the picture -- thankfully, that's most of the movie -- Spider-Man: Homecoming is the fun playdate most of us have been looking forward to since the character stole Cap's shield last spring in Captain America: Civil War. It's a relief to see a superhero engaged in deeply human activities, like getting ready for a date... This Spider-Man is still just a kid, after all, and he has no energy for existential angst -- just dealing with hormones is enough. A welcome narrowing of the Marvel mega-verse away from alien invasions and globe-smashing supervillains and back towards something more intimate. A little of the new Spider-Man went an exhilaratingly long way in Captain America: Civil War last year. But a lot of him goes almost nowhere in this slack and spiritless solo escapade. Mr. Holland looks and sounds more like a teen than the actors who've previously suited up for this series, and he has fine support from a cast that includes Jacob Batalon as Peter's best friend. It's not only the best Spider-Man movie -- it's one of the best films in Marvel's cinematic universe. Director Jon Watts nicely handles the scenes of adolescent banter and awkwardness; if anything, they're more engaging than the action sequences. One might be tempted to have a few cynical thoughts about Spider-Man: Homecoming, were it not for the puppyish form of British actor Tom Holland in the red-and-blue superhero onesie.

For a film with six screenwriters, Homecoming creates a remarkably coherent vision of a smart kid still dumb about the world, battling the learning curves of his double lives.

Well, when you've got it, you've got it. Against considerable odds, ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" finds its pace and rhythm by the end. It delivers eye-popping spectacle in spades, but it's the characters that make it count. Even those of us who regard the Marvel aesthetic as a plague on world cinema can find much in Spider-Man: Homecoming to be charmed by. Beginning with a score that riffs on the late-'70s cartoon and closing with a slyly funny after-credits scene, it's as sure-footed as its arachnid namesake. The movie lacks inspiration; even the big ""twist"" is more worthy of a suppressed chuckle than a dropped jaw - it's like something pulled out of a bad soap opera. Adolescent in all the right ways: limber, reckless, full of youthful brio and uncertainty. The movie breaks no new ground, and action sequences that were intended to be thrilling - such as an epic battle on the Staten Island Ferry - just sit there on the screen, incapable of stirring a single pulse, but content in their competence.

Tom Holland's Peter Parker, one of the liveliest characters in last year's Captain America: Civil War, now has an entire movie devoted to him - one with plenty of youthful snap and crackle.

An authentic, refreshingly nerdy and high-spirited reboot of the well-worn Marvel franchise ... The costumed antics of Homecoming are a joy to watch, with tense set pieces and well-choreographed action, but some of the movie's brightest spots are in its more down-to-earth moments. Just as the character's primary goal here is about proving himself, in terms of Marvel injecting a rejuvenating vitality into its wayward wall-crawler, ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" clears that bar and then some.

A masterpiece of pop filmmaking -- a fantastic, exuberant entertainment that manages to be both sleek and substantial without being patronizing.

Spider-Man 3 kicks off this Summer of Sequels in big, loud, occasionally clever, but more often meandering ways. It's not dull, exactly, but neither is it much fun. There are so many super-villains buzzing around like flies in Spider-Man 3 that the web of plots, subplots, flashbacks and unnecessary character amplifications makes it feel more like Spider-Man. Over-produced, over-publicized, over-designed, over-computerized and just plain over the moon, it's so preposterously overwrought with so many bewildering plots juggling simultaneously for over-emphasis, there's no entry point for criticism. Spider-Man 3 is product, but it's a machine that tickles your eyes. No matter how much it costs and what its flaws, Spider-Man 3 still gets a lot of bang for the buck. On the ground, Spider-Man 3 is dreary. But in the air, it swings. The movie has the curious effect of leaving you over-fulfilled. When it's done, any appetite for another event picture, even one half as well made as this, is temporarily curbed.

Spider-Man 3 is far from a flop, and I'm sure the Spider-maniacs will eat it up. For me, it's a buffet without much aftertaste. In an apparent effort to put a stake in the heart of the franchise that threatens to define his career, director Sam Raimi has delivered an overlong, visually incoherent, mean-spirited and often just plain awful Spider-Man 3. It's odd to think of Spider-Man 2 as a small movie, but next to the clanking, wheezing contraption that is Spider-Man 3, that $784 million-grossing megahit feels like some little Sundance indie. Spider-Man 3 offers a touching portrait of the need for humility in the face of great success. It's a lesson the creators of this oversized blockbuster-in-waiting might have taken a little more to heart. At 140 minutes, it's not a difficult movie to sit through. It's just difficult to enjoy. Maguire has made Peter/Spidey all his own; the supporting characters are marvelous, but it's his brave, soulful work that pulls it all together. My guess is that when the summer blockbuster season finishes pummeling us with formula, Spider-Man 3 is going to look like one of the few that was touched by human hands. I liked it. To place a sensitive story in a male-epic genre -- to dramatize feelings of angst and personal betrayal worthy of an Ingmar Bergman film, and then to dress them up in gaudy comic-book colors -- is to pull off a smartly subversive drag show. This is a wonderfully imagined, heartfelt piece of pop entertainment that soars not only for its spectacular eye candy, but also during the moments when its protagonists simply stand still and talk to each other. What's with all the crying? Both heroes and villains shed tears so readily, you almost want to stand up mid-screening and ask director Sam Raimi to stop the projector so everybody can have a group hug. The script is busy with so many supporting characters and plot detours that the series' charming idiosyncrasy is sometimes lost in the noise. Fortunately, it's entertaining noise. The result? Predictably, by the time of the big, swinging-through-the-concrete-canyons climax, we've pretty much lost interest. The combat showstoppers, though still too CG to be felt as much as they're admired, should thrill fanboys to no end. As last year's Bond reboot Casino Royale made obvious, less is the new more. Spider-Man, stop your engines. What's worse is that after a fairly pedestrian opening, director Sam Raimi loses all control of the film as it rambles from storyline to storyline in search of a center. Director Sam Raimi tries to pump some life into this dutiful enterprise but seems more than a little bored himself, especially when he's getting mushy about Spider-Man's moral decline and regeneration. No one will feel cheated -- the movie isn't a careless cop-out -- but somehow Spidey has gotten tangled up in his overlong, overdone and underthought web.

The film doesn't teem; it just seems cluttered - a collection of scenes, and occasionally great visuals or gags, strung together by an inadequate plot. As he scampers around the bathtub of popular culture, Spidey is beginning to exhaust everyone's patience. It's a towering disappointment. Aesthetically and conceptually wrung out, fizzled rather than fizzy, this latest installment in the spider-bites-boy adventure story shoots high, swings low and every so often hits the sweet spot, but mostly just plods and plods along.

An enjoyably stacked entertainment, equally crunchy and silky in its desire to be as appetizing a two hours as you could spend in suspended disbelief. Split is all about atmosphere and build-up, which Shyamalan renders suitably claustrophobic. I went with it. I got back on that M. Night bandwagon, and the finish line in particular was just spectacularly fantastic. Shyamalan's skill as a filmmaker-his instincts for crisp editing, his knack for navigating shifting points of view-have always been stronger than his ideas. That's true here, too, yet Split is compulsively watchable. Like the villain of Split, Shyamalan's worst enemy just might be himself. When Shyamalan embraces his identity as a horror director with a knack for surprises, more fun is had by all. For most of its nearly two-hour running time, ""Split"" is quite enjoyable, a clever one-up of ""Psycho"" with some interesting twists and several funny-creepy moments. The movie falls oddly flat: less tantalizingly enigmatic ""et cetera"" than ""blah blah blah."" Split's giddy nonsense ultimately dissolves in a scrum of half-realized ideas, but maybe that's exactly Shyamalan's goal ... M. Night Shyamalan's story of a kidnapper with serious identity issues is an acting showcase for James McAvoy - and first-rate creepfest. Moodying with faux menace around the nutter's underworld, Shyamalan fails to develop his three-pack of vapid victims and pads his script with go-nowhere plot twists. Having weathered the ups and downs of more than 20 years in Hollywood, Shyamalan proves he's still capable of delivering a harrowing thriller, one smartly of a piece with his cinematic past, yet standing on its own as a diverting experience. Distressing, narratively convenient exploitation that gets by on the strength of McAvoy's fearless, electrifyingly adaptive performance. This measured, diligently crafted register feels like Shyamalan back on home turf. Split is funnier, campier, and more freewheeling than anything its writer-director has done-slightly overlong, but reminiscent of Brian De Palma films like The Fury and Femme Fatale in its refusal to be boring. ""Split"" doesn't just revive Shyamalan's career; it resurrects his brand. Split is a deeply disturbing film that covers every evil human deed from kidnapping to cannibalism. But it's also wildly funny in parts. The narrative is choppy, the tension is less pervasive than it should be, and there's no ending. The film contends that people are purified by suffering. Having suffered through the screening, I'm still waiting for my purer self to kick in.

But it's also wildly funny in parts. Shyamalan demonstrates a mastery over the form of the mean and lean psycho-thriller, aided in no small party by the performances of McAvoy, Taylor-Joy and Buckley, and smooth-yet-unsettling camera work by cinematographer Michael Gioulakis. Directed by M Night Shyamalan, the horror-thriller is full of plot holes, but McAvoy's joyful and menacingly lunatic performance papers over most of them. Shyamalan juggles all these borrowed balls with grace and skill; it's only when he adds in some of his own that he falters. Shyamalan is a one-trick pony who needs to find a new rodeo. Shyamalan's popcorn picture is head-scramblingly strange - a chiller where both the bad guy and his victims are, well, victims. Shyamalan has made the straightest thriller of his career, nearly free of the misguided detours and bonkers twists that made him famous. You wish it were messier. It's a mystery that falls apart at the first touch. McAvoy is excellent, but, for pure squeals and entertainment, the film falls short of Shyamalan's The Visit from 2015.

Quite apart from being a raucously funny comedy, it could be the most significant feminist film of the year. This Miss Moneypenny could be worth billions. Spy is a call to arms for the cowed, and a riotous skewering of the workplace kings If they do a sequel (teased in the final seconds), they should cut down on the endless, tedious chases and shootouts. McCarthy is not a one-size-fits-all talent; she needs the right vehicle. Here, Feig has given her precisely the right vehicle, and she shines. Although this fish-out-of-water scenario might sound over-familiar, both the humour and action here are startling and visceral ... It's a globe-trotting tour of McCarthy's talent, throughout which she's practically always kicking butt. Who was that double-O-what's-his-face, anyway? The problem is that spy movies have been spoofed so many times that the jokes often feel as tatty and old as the CIA's rodent-infested headquarters. An action-comedy that takes the bankrupt Bond genre out for a fresh and subversive airing. Melissa McCarthy doesn't just adopt guises to fool the bad guys in ""Spy."" Part of what makes the action comedy such a loopy blast is the identity shifts she pulls on the audience. It's an entertaining piece of silliness, though it looks like a decision has been made to balance out the female star with some weirdly explicit violence and salty cuss-words, perhaps to reassure the male demographic ... Feig keeps throwing so much stuff at you - gross-out gags, chases, brutal violence, not to mention actors working their heads off - that he finally wears down your resistance. If a Spy sequel isn't already in the works, they better get cracking. Nefarious terrorists and numskull guys await. Spy is actually quite funny. It even proves itself to be in the same league with the first two films in Feig's loose comic trilogy, Bridesmaids and The Heat ... A breezy, enjoyable comedy, and an ideal vehicle for the endearing McCarthy. Feig draws out McCarthy's best, and she's up to the challenge, whether it's expressing tenderness and anger or slapsticking her way through the physical humor. Feig once again demonstrates his shrewd eye for mixing talent, finding a (mis)match made in action-comedy heaven in regular collaborator Melissa McCarthy and resident British hard man Jason Statham. ""Spy"" may not be a great movie, but it is great fun. And at times it will have you wondering if there's that much of a difference. With the overlong, limp and lazy ""Spy,"" Feig has lost his mojo. Finally, after the promise shown in ""Bridesmaids"" but sold short since by weak scripts in films like ""Tammy"" and ""Identity Thief,"" Melissa McCarthy gets a movie vehicle worthy of her talents. One part parody, one part thriller, one part lethal satire of movie sexism. The intel is in: Melissa McCarthy can carry a comedy. Specifically, ""Spy."" McCarthy and director Paul Feig, are a dynamite team, with Feig's script a bonanza of zingers and femcentric subtext. Spy lampoons sexism without abandoning sex-a tough tone for a comedy to strike but one that Feig and McCarthy manage to accomplish with both a sense of justice and a sense of humor. As McCarthy vehicles go, Spy is aggressively mid-range and has too many miles on the clock, but it chugs along entertainingly. Feig's movies aren't particularly stylish - the visuals in ""Spy"" are serviceable at best, and the makeup is particularly un-subtle - but they possess a silly, sweet streak that makes them irresistibly infectious. The fun of ""Spy"" comes in watching the right actors mess with their own images, blithely. Everyone involved seems to have had a good time with ""Spy,"" and so will the audience. Rare is the broad mainstream comedy that can goof on its bigger-budget Hollywood siblings while providing a few moments of sincere uplift. The characters are one-dimensional. The narrative is flat and obvious. As seen in previous films, McCarthy works best with others and Feig here provides a fine array of foils. The busy, silly script allows Ms. McCarthy to be her own best sidekick, in effect an entire sketch-comedy troupe unto herself. ""Spy,"" + popcorn, feels just right. McCarthy is not a one-size-fits-all talent; she needs the right vehicle. Here, Feig has given her precisely the right vehicle, and she shines. Although this fish-out-of-water scenario might sound over-familiar, both the humour and action here are startling and visceral ... It's a globe-trotting tour of McCarthy's talent, throughout which she's practically always kicking butt. Who was that double-O-what's-his-face, anyway? The problem is that spy movies have been spoofed so many times that the jokes often feel as tatty and old as the CIA's rodent-infested headquarters. An action-comedy that takes the bankrupt Bond genre out for a fresh and subversive airing. Melissa McCarthy doesn't just adopt guises to fool the bad guys in ""Spy."" Part of what makes the action comedy such a loopy blast is the identity shifts she pulls on the audience. It's an entertaining piece of silliness, though it looks like a decision has been made to balance out the female star with some weirdly explicit violence and salty cuss-words, perhaps to reassure the male demographic ... Feig keeps throwing so much stuff at you - gross-out gags, chases, brutal violence, not to mention actors working their heads off - that he finally wears down your resistance. If a Spy sequel isn't already in the works, they better get cracking. Nefarious terrorists and numskull guys await. Spy is actually quite funny. It even proves itself to be in the same league with the first two films in Feig's loose comic trilogy, Bridesmaids and The Heat ... A breezy, enjoyable comedy, and an ideal vehicle for the endearing McCarthy. Feig draws out McCarthy's best, and she's up to the challenge, whether it's expressing tenderness and anger or slapsticking her way through the physical humor. Feig once again demonstrates his shrewd eye for mixing talent, finding a (mis)match made in action-comedy heaven in regular collaborator Melissa McCarthy and resident British hard man Jason Statham. ""Spy"" may not be a great movie, but it is great fun. And at times it will have you wondering if there's that much of a difference. With the overlong, limp and lazy ""Spy,"" Feig has lost his mojo. Finally, after the promise shown in ""Bridesmaids"" but sold short since by weak scripts in films like ""Tammy"" and ""Identity Thief,"" Melissa McCarthy gets a movie vehicle worthy of her talents. One part parody, one part thriller, one part lethal satire of movie sexism. The intel is in: Melissa McCarthy can carry a comedy. Specifically, ""Spy."" McCarthy and director Paul Feig, are a dynamite team, with Feig's script a bonanza of zingers and femcentric subtext. Spy lampoons sexism without abandoning sex-a tough tone for a comedy to strike but one that Feig and McCarthy manage to accomplish with both a sense of justice and a sense of humor. As McCarthy vehicles go, Spy is aggressively mid-range and has too many miles on the clock, but it chugs along entertainingly. Feig's movies aren't particularly stylish - the visuals in ""Spy"" are serviceable at best, and the makeup is particularly un-subtle - but they possess a silly, sweet streak that makes them irresistibly infectious. The fun of ""Spy"" comes in watching the right actors mess with their own images, blithely. Everyone involved seems to have had a good time with ""Spy,"" and so will the audience. Rare is the broad mainstream comedy that can goof on its bigger-budget Hollywood siblings while providing a few moments of sincere uplift. The characters are one-dimensional.

What does work, in every scene, is Melissa McCarthy's performance. She's as funny and as winning as anyone in the movies these days. Feig's cheerfully feminist script makes only as much sense as it absolutely must, while providing McCarthy with chances to crack wise, show vulnerability and class, and do some of the more elegant pratfalls you'll have seen in a while. In Spy, she's playing a caricature that is almost a complete character. The movie isn't out to humiliate her. It wants to prop up a version of heroism that makes sense for McCarthy. On her own, Melissa McCarthy is hilarious. So is Rose Byrne. Together, they're spectacularly funny. Generously cast, sharply scripted and often vigorously improvised. [It] does have its moments, and it does have McCarthy. And while it's not worth much more than a rent, it does make us look forward to what she's going to do with ""Ghostbusters.""

The young cast is mostly callow and TV-bland and the special effects don't quite seem worth that hefty price tag, but overall this is a presentable addition to the franchise. With Star Trek Abrams honors the show's legacy without fossilizing its best qualities. Instead, he's whisked it off to a planet where numbing nostalgia can't kill it, and where the future is still something to look forward to. The wit and youthful energy that's been infused into the new Star Trek should enable this venerable franchise to live longer and prosper more handsomely. In going back to tell the Enterprise story from the beginning, Star Trek presses collective emotional buttons people didn't even know they had. At its best, the effect is like seeing life panoramically, past and future, simultaneous and magnificent. Star Trek goes back to the legend's roots with a boldness that brings a fatigued franchise back to life. You needn't know the secret handshakes or utter the Vulcan blessing ""live long and prosper"" to gain admission to, and enjoy, summer's first thrill ride. In his daft, dizzy reinvention of a moribund franchise, Abrams has found a way to be referential without being reverential, to conjure nostalgia without being constrained by it. The overall impression is one of unbridled enthusiasm on the part of the film's makers, both for its predecessors and for the brave new universe Abrams and his crew are exploring. J. J. Abrams's thriller Star Trek is the first tent-pole film that has made me sob with pure pleasure. Fast-moving, funny, exciting warp-speed entertainment and, heaven help me, even quite moving - the kind of film that shows that, like it or not, commercial cinema can still deliver a sledgehammer punch. It sure didn't feel like a trek to me. This is a grand success - perhaps a new populist benchmark in what to do with a flagging franchise, and a witty, light-on-its-feet prequel which makes instant toast of X-Men Origins: Wolverine. May it live long and prosper, by which we mean, sequels, soon Star Trek used to be smarter. But it was never this fast, fresh and exciting. But idolaters need fear no iconoclasm and newcomers no exclusion. The start of a presumably new chapter in the franchise is marked by affectionate respect tempered with an eye for modern visual tastes. There will be plenty of takers for this Enterprise, I think, but they shouldn't count on seeing much that's new in the course of it. Star Trek is everything that fans could have hoped for. It throbs with a dynamism that we haven't seen in the series for a very long time and creates a slice of expertly crafted science-fiction escapism. You do get a sense, despite all the other attempts to re-do Star Trek, that this lot boldly go where no man has gone before, and that Abrams has reinvented the series without murdering everything that has gone before. The young cast is mostly callow and TV-bland and the special effects don't quite seem worth that hefty price tag, but overall this is a presentable addition to the franchise. With Star Trek Abrams honors the show's legacy without fossilizing its best qualities. Instead, he's whisked it off to a planet where numbing nostalgia can't kill it, and where the future is still something to look forward to. The wit and youthful energy that's been infused into the new Star Trek should enable this venerable franchise to live longer and prosper more handsomely. In going back to tell the Enterprise story from the beginning, Star Trek presses collective emotional buttons people didn't even know they had. At its best, the effect is like seeing life panoramically, past and future, simultaneous and magnificent. Star Trek goes back to the legend's roots with a boldness that brings a fatigued franchise back to life. You needn't know the secret handshakes or utter the Vulcan blessing ""live long and prosper"" to gain admission to, and enjoy, summer's first thrill ride. In his daft, dizzy reinvention of a moribund franchise, Abrams has found a way to be referential without being reverential, to conjure nostalgia without being constrained by it. The overall impression is one of unbridled enthusiasm on the part of the film's makers, both for its predecessors and for the brave new universe Abrams and his crew are exploring. J. J. Abrams's thriller Star Trek is the first tent-pole film that has made me sob with pure pleasure. Fast-moving, funny, exciting warp-speed entertainment and, heaven help me, even quite moving - the kind of film that shows that, like it or not, commercial cinema can still deliver a sledgehammer punch. It sure didn't feel like a trek to me. This is a grand success - perhaps a new populist benchmark in what to do with a flagging franchise, and a witty, light-on-its-feet prequel which makes instant toast of X-Men Origins: Wolverine.

12555,m/star_trek_beyond,"An enjoyably old-fashioned entry in the new series. Short on back story, long on action, loads of fun. It makes very few promises it can't keep, but also goes halfway out on every limb it can find, risking next to nothing, sights permalocked on par. Ultimately, Beyond is a movie about characters - and character. But that's half the battle. The other half of the battle is... battle. And Lin, who has such a strong track record with vehicular mayhem, doesn't bring his ""A"" game. While he may have seemed like a counterintuitive choice to take over a Star Trek movie, Lin is absolutely in his element whenever the film becomes about bodies and vehicles moving swiftly through space - which is often. ""Star Trek Beyond"" is a somewhat diverting place holder, but one hopes that the next ""Star Trek"" movie will have what it takes to boldly go where no ""Star Trek"" movie has gone before. While this is not your father's ""Star Trek,"" it still feels like a fan's - and just the kind of warm, inclusive, feel-good entertainment this summer needs. An entertaining adventure. The script injects a welcome strain of humor that's true to the original Gene Roddenberry creation, delivering nostalgia without stiff veneration. This episode cuts right to the core of the series's original appeal, giving the terrific cast a chance to play against one another in a straightforward story. It's not exactly bold, but ""Beyond"" does satisfy. While ""Star Trek Beyond"" lacks a center, it compensates with an endless parade of distractions. When the movie moves along at a breezy clip, it's partly because it feels so purposeless. Not since the original crew stepped down have we felt such a vivid sense of adventure and comradeship.

Star Trek Beyond is a snappy, diverting affair that nevertheless leaves a lingering feeling, like Kirk, that something's missing. Star Trek Beyond, like most of the rebooted properties flying around our movie theaters, delights in nostalgically resurrecting iconic characters and tweaking them anew. Though the action-packed trailers might suggest he simply launched that manic vibe into space, Lin and scriptwriters Simon Pegg and Doug Jung made a clever plot move that gives Beyond the most breathing room for its characters in years. Lin's movie works best when approached as a relaxed, somewhat playful two-hour expansion of one of the old '60s episodes.

Thanks to Lin's steady directorial hand and knack for visualizing improbable set-pieces, the new film is bold, breathless and propulsive, a distillation of the action movie to its purest elements. It would be optimistic to expect the franchise to venture into new conceptual territory at this point. As in the Abrams films, a vague pacifist message is undercut by the frenetic, bloodlessly violent action obligatory in modern Hollywood blockbusters. Not every wheel needs reinventing, and one of the abiding pleasures of ""Star Trek,"" in its old and newer iterations, lies in its balance of stubborn consistency and canny inventiveness.

Everything you want a post-modern ""Trek"" movie to be: funny, poppy, self-referential -- and with Captain Kirk punching bad guys in rubber masks. It delivers a satisfying and amusing dollop of sci-fi comfort food. The fact that the result is serviceable, delivering enough value to be worth a fan's time, is about as good as one could reasonably expect. ""Star Trek Beyond"" is better than not-bad. By any earthly standard it's good. Sci-fi fans will surely see beyond any shortcomings and appreciate a film full of visual dazzle, action and suspense. Justin Lin has taken over the helm from J.J. Abrams, but he's not about to change course, at least as far as reusing old material goes. There is plenty in Star Trek Beyond for diehard Trekkers to enjoy, and director Justin Lin guns the action sequences - even if that motocross machine that Kirk is ostensibly riding looks totally fake and video-game-ish. Granted, with all the galaxies at its disposal, and yet another TV series in dry dock, one might hope for a Star Trek movie with a bit more narrative heft. But in terms of delivering solid entertainment for its devoted base? Mission accomplished. The pattern for these pictures has been set for decades, and this latest entry in the series breaks little new ground. It might even feel like you're back in your rec room, circa 1967, drinking Tang and waiting for the Tribbles.

But it's a comfortable film...in which the familiar faces don't go anywhere no man has gone before - boldly or otherwise - but they seem to be having a rousing good time anyway. They should have called it ""Star Trek Into Drowsiness."" Lin seems most concerned with keeping things moving, and on that score he succeeds. Lin knows how to shoot his fights from unexpected angles and with enough spatial-temporal variables to keep us jolt-addicts rocking in our seat, happy to be dizzy. Though its sense of peril would barely raise a sweat in a kindergarten, the film has surprising vim for the third part in a franchise inspired by a 50-year-old TV show. There are bright, busy ""Star Trek"" movies, full of wit and interest, and then there are ""Star Trek"" movies like this one, that are subdued and dark, as if imbued with the monotony of being stuck on a space ship for five long years. Lin keeps this tense adventure ... from stumbling over its own excess: he knows that any good Star Trek needs wit as well as spectacle. To reinvigorate the franchise's sense of purpose, new recruit Justin Lin takes things back to their roots and core values, while also injects some of the dynamic action that he has honed on multiple Fast and Furious sequels.

This third installment in the millennial Star Trek reboot races along without an idea in its head, often recalling the silly, monster-driven final season of the 60s TV show. The movie bounces along, hurtling its heroes over colliding wreckage and into currents of artificial gravity, pausing just long enough for a punchline or a knowing exchange of looks. Come to 'Star Trek Beyond' for the pow; stay for the emotional wipeout. Lin and his cast's clear affection for the material helps temper the familiarity. The Enterprise's mission was to explore strange new worlds. This movie's is to give us a smooth ride. It's not just a blast but, at moments, a thing of beauty, alive to the comic awesomeness of being lost in space. Star Trek Beyond is a Star Trek movie, although not an especially good one. The actors work so well together that they reinforce the series' central appeal: This crew is like family. The movie never delivers on its considerable promise because it's always in such a hurry to get to the next action scene. It's exactly the kind of fun, steeped in effervescent goodwill that Hollywood should be delivering right now. Lin's flashy sense of stylized grit is lost in a sea of sci-fi noise as ""Beyond"" becomes a monotonous blur of space babble and battles. Beyond doesn't have the tactile crash-smash thrill of Vin Diesel gunning a Charger. It's more like that dumb gag in Furious 7 when cars skydive from a plane.

Abrams has a gift for making us feel as if Star Trek Into Darkness vaulted from our own Trek-ish daydreams. Darkness is a cheery combo of classic catchphrases and young Hollywood heat ... Star Trek Into Darkness may not go boldly back to the archives, but it serves up an exhilarating spectacle, with noteworthy moments of intimacy. Abrams gets considerable help from a cast who go after their roles with great zest. The new film works. It's rousing. The human element, and the Vulcan element, to say nothing of various other species, are present, accounted for and taken seriously enough to matter. A solid but unspectacular effort that sets the stage for the next chapters. The movie delivers the goods on both narrative and razzle-dazzle action levels. There's something especially disconcerting about Into Darkness's hollowness, given the visibly provocative content that, in true Trek fashion, is meant to put us in mind of our precarious present. An excessively derivative what-if rehash of themes and interactions that came before, most of the characters lesser copies and even caricatures of the originals. The movie presses forward with a high-spirited wit and sense of purpose that makes other action extravaganzas look backward. The action is exhilarating, the visual effects spectacular - and spectacularly realized. One of the general strengths of Star Trek Into Darkness, in fact, is the feeling of high stakes and genuine threat, which is exceedingly hard to pull off in any long-running franchise. ""Into Darkness"" is fast and fun, zipping along on all thrusters while everyone on the bridge settles comfortably into an agreeably lighthearted vibe (and into ever-slimmer outfits). [Provides] bustling fun equal to its modest ambitions ... A stunningly nervy sequel that vaporizes any worries that Abrams' terrific 2009 reboot was a fluke. The only darkness here - besides the dingy-looking images dimmed by 3-D glasses - is the murky plot, which is as silly as it is arbitrary.

It's a great deal of brash fun, and it should satisfy all those basic Trekkie cravings. For all its reckoning with mass destruction, this franchise's vision of a future Earth remains optimistic. The film mixes the iconically familiar with the futuristic. Star Trek Into Darkness banishes, at least for the moment, the lugubrious mood and sepulchral look that too many comic-book movies mistake for sophistication. All hail an action film that isn't ashamed to have fun and to be seen doing it. Like its entertaining predecessor, ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" offers much of what the fans expect and not much of what they don't. This character-driven vehicle is a supercharged example of cinematic craftsmanship. There's absolutely nothing wrong with ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" -- once you understand it as a generic comic-book-style summer flick faintly inspired by some half-forgotten boomer culture thing. J.J. Abrams' second Star Trek movie is chock-full of goodies, but by the last quarter the action is so inflated and relentless that it's like an anvil chorus played on your head. Maybe it is too late to lament the militarization of Star Trek, but in his pursuit of blockbuster currency, Mr. Abrams has sacrificed a lot of its idiosyncrasy and, worse, the large-spirited humanism that sustained it. You barely get a chance to catch a breath as this saga takes off like a starship and just keeps going, from its Indiana Jones-style opening to its cosmos-rattling finale. And all in 3D, no less. Abrams' sophomore effort picks its references well, builds on the relationships established in the original series (and tweaked in the last movie) and keeps the quips and battles coming.

The film is, for whatever else it might be, one of the funniest of the Star Trek entries. Star Trek Into Darkness is a step forward from Abrams' initial foray into this universe in the 2009 movie. For two movies in a row now -- and possibly even more in the second than the first -- [Abrams has] caught some of the spark of the first Star Trek without either mimicking or desecrating the original. The result is a wild piece of entertainment that manages to be about something. Beam yourself up for this one. J.J. Abrams's Star Trek Into Darkness, the sequel to his prequel, delivers the goods, even if some of the goods are less than fresh. Rip-roaring set-pieces aside, the biggest pleasure here is still the yin-yang chemistry between Kirk and Spock, even as the writers sand down the barbed edges of the characters' interactions. ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is one of the most aggressively self-conscious summer blockbusters ever made. Abrams boldly goes into Star Trek Into Darkness, and crushes it again. It's more fun and more intense, without giving less to the characters. This is sufficiently rousing and entertaining that it should please a majority of movie-goers whether they're confessed Trek fans or not. While the action is often electric, it's the relationships that matter. That, and a lippy regard for a cultural legacy. The film is, for whatever else it might be, one of the funniest of the Star Trek entries. Star Trek Into Darkness is a step forward from Abrams' initial foray into this universe in the 2009 movie. For two movies in a row now -- and possibly even more in the second than the first -- [Abrams has] caught some of the spark of the first Star Trek without either mimicking or desecrating the original. The result is a wild piece of entertainment that manages to be about something. Beam yourself up for this one. J.J. Abrams's Star Trek Into Darkness, the sequel to his prequel, delivers the goods, even if some of the goods are less than fresh. Rip-roaring set-pieces aside, the biggest pleasure here is still the yin-yang chemistry between Kirk and Spock, even as the writers sand down the barbed edges of the characters' interactions. ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is one of the most aggressively self-conscious summer blockbusters ever made. Abrams boldly goes into Star Trek Into Darkness, and crushes it again. It's more fun and more intense, without giving less to the characters. This is sufficiently rousing and entertaining that it should please a majority of movie-goers whether they're confessed Trek fans or not. For all its chasing and falling and fighting-and the movie supplies a great deal of each-Star Trek Into Darkness is at its best when the Enterprise crew are merely bickering and bantering among themselves: less space opera than soap opera. The conceptual sci-fi of the original series is nowhere to be found, though you might enjoy watching the skinny young actors approximate their counterparts from the 60s; Chris Pine is especially good as Captain Kirk.

12568,m/star_wars_episode_i_the_phantom_menace,"This film has a strange air of nada about it. This is a franchise in deep spiritual trouble. I can't convey the essence of the plot because I wasn't clear about it even as it was happening. Too bad writer-director Lucas left out the gee-whiz enthusiasm of the original movies. He also left out memorable characters. He left out the fun. Joyless, overly reverential and impenetrably plotted! A solar bore! Perhaps Lucas has become too lost in his mastery of computer-generated effects and digital sound to remember that creativity in the movies is not just a technical thing. An absolute disaster! Even without aliens, though, the humanity in Phantom Menace would still be hard to find. Not bad for a toy commercial, and the SF settings, however familiar, are even more impressive than the gadgets and beasties. The actors are wallpaper, the jokes are juvenile, there's no romance, and the dialogue lands with the thud of a computer-instruction manual. With Phantom, Lucas has brought the series to the brink of total artificiality, the future as a video game. There is nothing in this noisy, overdesigned bore to equal the excitement generated by the mere idea of the trailer. This isn't a film that will change history the way the first Star Wars did 22 years ago. There is a sense of discovery in scene after scene of The Phantom Menace. Story. Character. They used to mean something to George Lucas. It sustains the gee-whiz spirit of the series and offers a swashbuckling extragalactic getaway, creating illusions that are even more plausible than the kitchen-raiding raptors of Jurassic Park. Who would have guessed that The Phantom Menace would be so incoherent, so completely bereft of a grand adventure's surging thrills? A highly entertaining and visually breathtaking movie, capable at times of rocking and delighting you. Spectacular yet remote. A testimony to how far special effects have come. Phantom had me from the moment it touched down on Naboo. Incomplete, but still fun. The wow-factor action is irresistible, and Lloyd is no less appealing than '60s Disney star Kevin Corcoran. A breathless, exciting family movie with a couple of truly memorable sequences, and just enough in the way of story and character to keep the franchise going for another 20 years. The computer-generated creatures and characters are splendid, the kingdom of Naboo is a colorful paradise, and Trish Biggar's costume designs for Queen Amidala lets young actress Natalie Portman shine in her regal best. To pull a switch on Obi-Wan, I have a good feeling about this. For now, The Phantom Menace is a phantom movie, the merest hint of a terrific saga that the final two episodes of the new trilogy may reveal. At least, that's what we, and Hollywood, want to believe. Hype, after all, is just moviespeak for hope. After waiting 16 years for the overture to this epic saga, this is what we get? An in-progress trade war? What's missing from George Lucas' heralded return to the screen is . . . sex. In special effects, Lucas has moved a galaxy beyond. In energy, not yet. Lucas' directorial attention is clearly not focused on the cast, most of whom seem slightly adrift. Creating a so-called modern legend, droning on about The Force and all the rest of it, is no substitute for the full engagement of our senses. Everything about this film is so mechanical you wonder if it was written, directed and acted by 'droids.' Many of the scenes feel shapeless and flat-they're not ended, but abandoned. Even without the pre-release hoopla, The Phantom Menace would be a considerable letdown. Delivers exactly what every kid of any age wants: wows. And plenty of them! Lucas has proved he has the Naboos to pull it off again. The Phantom Menace takes twists and turns you don't expect. Pure adventure! A vigorous, romping, hugely entertaining movie! Visually dazzling, inventive beyond imagining and full of resonant detail that recalls stories told or hints at those to come! It is neither captivating nor transporting, for it lacks any emotional pull, as well as the sense of wonder and awe that marks the best works of sci-fi/fantasy. Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace seems designed more as a promotion for Lucasfilm's billion-dollar merchandising concerns than a meaningful chapter in the Star Wars canon. Too busy and talky by half, overpopulated by a baffling array of aliens and robot 'droids,' The Phantom Menace fails to engage the audience in its mythic quest `to restore balance to the Force.'

For those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects, the new Star Wars installment hasn't escaped the rut dug by the last one.

A decidedly mixed bag. In a time when, more often than not, sequels disappoint, it's refreshing to uncover something this high-profile that fulfils the promise of its name and adds another title to a storied legacy. This thing will have your mind glazed over faster than a glob of dough in a Krispy Kreme plant. Much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie. Lucas' gift for animating the inanimate turns out to be paralleled by a tendency to deaden what should be completely alive.

All those who wondered whether writer-director George Lucas was going to end his sci-fi career in a downward tailspin can rest easy. What a shock when George Lucas finds his footing and the saga once again takes hold. It provides fun and closure, wrapping up the saga's many narrative strings in an entertaining finale. Same logo. Same starry-night spacescape. Same music. Same crawl. Same everything. Only different. And so much better. For many, the Sith finale will redeem all three prequels. Others will wonder why Lucas wasted so many dollars, years and pixels on a story that could have been told in one film, or better yet, not at all. Lucas still can't write. His dialogue crashes and burns like an X-wing zapped out of the sky by a star destroyer. To say that Revenge of the Sith is a vast improvement is not extravagant praise -- but neither is it any kind of putdown. All those who wondered whether writer-director George Lucas was going to end his sci-fi career in a downward tailspin can rest easy. Just when you thought it was safe to ridicule everything Star Wars, Lucas returns from his flirtation with the Dark Side by crafting a terrific caper to his monumental series. A film that never wields the dramatic impact its plot should demand, and never realises the emotional potential at its dark heart. Revenge of the Sith might be tolerable if it weren't designed to be taken seriously. For fans it will be nirvana, and for everyone else a welcome relief. Revenge of the Sith is a brilliant consummation to a promise made a long time ago, far, far away, in a galaxy called 1977. Watching Revenge of the Sith, it's hard not to wonder if Lucas even knows how good a movie he almost made. George Lucas had lost his way for many years, gone to filmmaking's dark side. But now he's mustered up completely unexpected reserve for a last-minute redemption. Revenge of the Sith overcomes its dime-store dialogue and less than convincing performances through the sheer force of its director's vision. It's better than Episode I and not quite as good as Episode II. What it isn't is a lot of fun. More than a first-rate wrap-up job, it stands on its own as a dazzling piece of showmanship. Revenge of the Sith is more of the same: wildly flamboyant effects serving weak characters, bad acting and obtuse plotting. Man: 'You're so beautiful.' Woman: 'It's only because I'm so in love.' Man: 'No, it's because I'm so in love with you.' Me: 'Man oh man.' George Lucas makes it easy to experience Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith as a rush of deliverance -- even if the movie itself doesn't fully deliver. It's good. I mean really good.

Oh, the relief to reach the conclusion of Star Wars Episode III, not because George Lucas has brought home the franchise safe and sound but because I know I will never have to sit through another minute of this turgid, subliterate spaceballs again. If you've seen the others, you'll want to see this one. Let's face it -- there's no turning back. Like the most heavily-effects-budgeted shoulder shrug in history.

12573,m/star_wars_the_last_jedi,"[Rian Johnson] achieves what no one else has since The Empire Strikes Back: a fusion of junkyard genre parts and passion. [Director Rian Johnson's] movie has a sense of humor about itself and a sense of joy, but its emotional generosity, even in the midst of all the extravagant green-screen work, is its best special effect. You don't have to be a Star Wars fan to love this addition to the canon (heck, it works even if you haven't seen any of the other movies). In short, it feels like a new hope. As indebted to the previous installments and ""Star Wars"" canon as it is to classic Westerns, sword-and-sandal epics and martial arts films.... it's the blend of reverence for its roots and embrace of the new that makes ""The Last Jedi"" a triumph. The movie comes off as a work that's ironed out, flattened down, appallingly purified. Rian Johnson clearly remembers something that Lucas' most fervent followers sometimes forget: These are movies for the young, or at least the young at heart. The Last Jedi boasts many very good performances, ones that enrich the characters and which salute writer/director Johnson's ability to find the humanity within technology, something he proved early on with his artful time-travel thriller Looper. ""The Last Jedi"" may not possess its immediate predecessors' pleasant shock of the new, nor is it a stylistic detour from what's expected. But it makes up for this with wit, spirit and one wicked saber smackdown. It's a film of genuine beauty, one where you come away as eager to talk about the set design and the choreography as you do the fate of the galaxy or what might happen next. [Johnson's]often-stirring addition to the saga finally lands on an affecting point about the importance of preserving essential cultural tradition without clinging too strictly to the dogma -- and the texts -- of the old way. After this - I never thought I'd say it - I'm up for more. Bring on the next Star Wars. Everything a fan could want from a Star Wars film and then some. While there are elements nodding to The Empire Strikes Back, The Last Jedi is no copycat. In its most daring moments, it even tweaks a few series tropes, updating them with a decidedly populist kick. Writer-director Rian Johnson has certainly made the busiest Star Wars film of them all, but he keeps it from becoming a slog by infusing it with humor, verve, and visual charm. ""The Last Jedi"" has as much heart as it has guts and that's a stirring combination. You walk out of the cinema reminded why it's sometimes worth fighting a battle you may well lose. But gradually, Johnson's many additions become too much of a good thing and The Last Jedi grows crowded, busy and long. Last Jedi is deep. It's also rollicking. It's right up there with the very first Star Wars in terms of its enjoyability factor. It's a triumph. When everything pulls in the same direction, as it does consistently in ""The Last Jedi,"" it's like watching a mind-boggling clockwork click into a deft ballet. That said, I'd stop short of calling director Rian Johnson's undeniably impressive initiation into the Star Wars fold the masterpiece that some desperately want it to be. The film simply drags too much in the middle. You cannot kill the past. What you can do is build on it to enable an intriguing future. At the very least, The Last Jedi does that. The Last Jedi at its heart is a love letter to a childhood. From Luke's sly wink to an old friend to General Leia's leadership, the familiar heroes dominate the screen, earn the biggest applause and serve as a compass to the next generation. Taken as a whole, this eighth episode of the franchise will be porgnip for the faithful, though the answer to one of its Big Questions seems disappointing, and generously entertaining for the rest of us. When the feelings come in The Last Jedi, and they do come, they're deep and they're real. Go ahead and try to watch the penultimate scene without crying, or pretending not to. And may the Force be with you. It took them 40 years, but they've finally done it. The best Star Wars film of the series. There. That's it. It's that simple. It supplies us with all the things we expect - nay, demand - in a Star Wars movie, and manages to surprise us by revealing that this fictional universe, in which we've already clocked so many hours, can still surprise us. The future of the galaxy has never been in safer hands. By breaking down some of the old mythology, [Rian] Johnson has staked out new territory. For the first time in a long time, a ""Star Wars"" film feels forward-moving. The Last Jedi works on several levels, but most importantly it's a rip-roaring good time. That's what Star Wars fans want the most, and that's what they get with this dynamite installment. Sure, The Last Jedi can occasionally be too goofy or free-roaming for its own good, but it's an impossible film to sit in front of and not have a good time. The Last Jedi is funny, it's emotional, it's fast-paced and it has a good story to tell. [Rian] Johnson's ability to deliver a fresh and engaging riff on this beast of an enterprise suggests that not every free-spirited storyteller can be corrupted by Hollywood's dark side, and some may even give it a new hope. You don't see many sci-fi action extravaganzas that are about late middle-aged disappointment, about wondering what it's all about and whether any of it was worth it. It's this element that gives ""The Last Jedi"" an extra something ... The Johnson and Abrams movies live dutifully in the universe of the original George Lucas trilogy - after the Phantom Menace trilogy debacle, it's what fans claim they wanted. The Last Jedi mounts some genuinely startling narrative twists and feints, while charting an onward course for the franchise that has you itching to discover what comes next. A fresh visual style makes this middle ""Star Wars"" a welcome addition to the saga. The Last Jedi, written and directed by the gifted indie auteur Rian Johnson, nails the balance of novelty and nostalgia in much more satisfying fashion. That's not to say Star Wars: The Last Jedi will go down in history as a better movie than the franchise's gold standard, The Empire Strikes Back, but director Rian Johnson has pulled off a complete rejuvenation of the saga. Falls right behind Empire Strikes Back and maybe the original film in providing the thrills and the heartbreak, the heroism and villainy, and the romance and betrayal that makes these films such a treat. Optimistically, The Last Jedi leaves plenty of intriguing possibilities for the climactic installment. But there's also the kind of room for improvement that remind us when it comes to Star Wars, such hopes -- new or otherwise -- spring eternal. A stellar entry that owes much to George Lucas' original films while finding a signature vibe of its own and unleashing a few welcome twists. Johnson is to be lauded for not locking himself into a retelling of the same old story. While there is plenty of familiarity -- this franchise basically demands it -- he isn't afraid to go in new directions. It is a satisfying, at times transporting entertainment. Remarkably, it has visual wit and a human touch, no small achievement for a seemingly indestructible machine that revved up 40 years ago and shows no signs of sputtering out (ever). Loaded with action and satisfying in the ways its loyal audience wants it to be ... generally pleasing even as it sometimes strains to find useful and/or interesting things for some of its characters to do. Still, this is no mere placeholder of a story. Huge, important things happen to characters secondary and primary. Surprises big and small abound. The Last Jedi gives you an explosive sugar rush of spectacle. It's a film that buzzes with belief in itself and its own mythic universe - a euphoric certainty that I think no other movie franchise has. The most intelligent film in the franchise by several light years, The Last Jedi can be seen as the space-opera equivalent of Clint Eastwood's revisionist western, Unforgiven. It may sound like a backhanded compliment, but with so much on the line, Johnson deserves credit for not messing things up. This is the longest movie in the franchise. It just doesn't feel that way. I haven't been this into a Star Wars picture since the Empire struck back in The Empire Strikes Back. Rolling up with the kind of intergalactic swagger that gives us a cosmically infuriating phone prank within the first five minutes, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a work of supreme confidence: witty, wild and free to roam unexplored territory. [Rian Johnson] achieves what no one else has since The Empire Strikes Back: a fusion of junkyard genre parts and passion. [Director Rian Johnson's] movie has a sense of humor about itself and a sense of joy, but its emotional generosity, even in the midst of all the extravagant green-screen work, is its best special effect. You don't have to be a Star Wars fan to love this addition to the canon (heck, it works even if you haven't seen any of the other movies). In short, it feels like a new hope. As indebted to the previous installments and ""Star Wars"" canon as it is to classic Westerns, sword-and-sandal epics and martial arts films.... it's the blend of reverence for its roots and embrace of the new that makes ""The Last Jedi"" a triumph. The movie comes off as a work that's ironed out, flattened down, appallingly purified. Rian Johnson clearly remembers something that Lucas' most fervent followers sometimes forget: These are movies for the young, or at least the young at heart. The Last Jedi boasts many very good performances, ones that enrich the characters and which salute writer/director Johnson's ability to find the humanity within technology, something he proved early on with his artful time-travel thriller Looper. ""The Last Jedi"" may not possess its immediate predecessors' pleasant shock of the new, nor is it a stylistic detour from what's expected. But it makes up for this with wit, spirit and one wicked saber smackdown. It's a film of genuine beauty, one where you come away as eager to talk about the set design and the choreography as you do the fate of the galaxy or what might happen next. [Johnson's]often-stirring addition to the saga finally lands on an affecting point about the importance of preserving essential cultural tradition without clinging too strictly to the dogma -- and the texts -- of the old way. After this - I never thought I'd say it - I'm up for more. Bring on the next Star Wars. Everything a fan could want from a Star Wars film and then some. While there are elements nodding to The Empire Strikes Back, The Last Jedi is no copycat. In its most daring moments, it even tweaks a few series tropes, updating them with a decidedly populist kick. Writer-director Rian Johnson has certainly made the busiest Star Wars film of them all, but he keeps it from becoming a slog by infusing it with humor, verve, and visual charm. ""The Last Jedi"" has as much heart as it has guts and that's a stirring combination. You walk out of the cinema reminded why it's sometimes worth fighting a battle you may well lose. But gradually, Johnson's many additions become too much of a good thing and The Last Jedi grows crowded, busy and long. Last Jedi is deep. It's also rollicking. It's right up there with the very first Star Wars in terms of its enjoyability factor. It's a triumph. When everything pulls in the same direction, as it does consistently in ""The Last Jedi,"" it's like watching a mind-boggling clockwork click into a deft ballet. That said, I'd stop short of calling director Rian Johnson's undeniably impressive initiation into the Star Wars fold the masterpiece that some desperately want it to be. The film simply drags too much in the middle. You cannot kill the past. What you can do is build on it to enable an intriguing future. At the very least, The Last Jedi does that. The Last Jedi at its heart is a love letter to a childhood. From Luke's sly wink to an old friend to General Leia's leadership, the familiar heroes dominate the screen, earn the biggest applause and serve as a compass to the next generation.

A harried and hectic affair. OK, the final episode isn't perfect. You'll nitpick it forever with your friends. But that's the point. Star Wars isn't a movie, it's family. We're that close to it. And the in-fighting about what it does right and wrong is as crucial as the love. [A] vast, convoluted, sometimes cluttered, intermittently thrilling and thoroughly entertaining production that brings the Skywalker trilogy to a heroic close. Despite some clunky chunks of exposition, the action rockets along, powered both by its need to be more spectacular than ever before and the script's desire to tie up the saga's many loose ends... It's a rousing finish. The Rise of Skywalker earns much of its affection with cameos, callbacks and other candy that will be best savored upon repeat viewings. It's not unlike a rollercoaster ride in that it has just enough thrills to satisfy fans, but you can also see exactly where the ride begins and ends before you strap in. ""Rise of Skywalker"" simply feels like a shrug of the shoulders and a march into the expected. ""Rise of Skywalker"" operates as if the only cinematic tradition at its disposal hails from a galaxy far, far away. For a movie predicated on satisfying fans, ""The Rise of Skywalker"" is a distinctly unsatisfying conclusion to what had been an imperfect but mostly good few films. The Rise of Skywalker is a fitting epitaph for the thrills and limits of repetition; may it be the last episode of a saga that should've ended long ago. The movie snaps together like a jigsaw puzzle, a series of concluding beats that seem inevitable and perfect, and designed to please all parties, so long as you don't dwell on the logic too much. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a fitting last movie. It's long; maddening; fun in bits; fantastic in parts; and so desperate to stir itself into legend that we urge it on, like parents screaming at their tots in an egg-and-spoon race. It's an accretion - a buildup of plotlines and characters that rolls toward its conclusion by dint of momentum lent to it by all that's come before. Star Wars IX may be imperfect, but it offers nostalgia hounds the space odyssey of their dreams. After more than 40 years, the ""Star Wars"" series comes in for a smooth landing. ""The Rise of Skywalker"" rarely comes close to touching greatness, but it's a solid, visually dazzling and warmhearted victory for the Force of quality filmmaking. Panders wildly, closing out this last chapter of the nine films that have come to be known as the Skywalker Saga with a story that delivers to the faithful exactly the movie they wanted. It wraps up the trio of trilogies begun in 1977 in a confident, soothingly predictable way, doing all that cinematically possible to avoid poking the bear otherwise known as tradition-minded quadrants of the ""Star Wars"" fan base. In its anxiety not to offend, it comes off more like fanfiction than the creation of actual professional filmmakers. A bot would be able to pull off a more surprising movie. What's the point in introducing so many interesting new characters and then pushing them through the blueprints of old adventures? After paying homage to everything that came before, this ""Star Wars"" ending is a too-safe landing of a massive pop-culture starship, and a spectacular finale that misses a chance to forge something special. Rather than making a movie some people might love, Abrams tried to make a movie no one would hate, and as a result, you don't feel much of anything at all.

Epic it indeed is, full of magnificent set pieces - sprawling space battles and incandescent lightsaber duels - gripping performances and a number of truly stunning surprises.

It's a somewhat soulless delivery system of catharsis, but Disney and Abrams are banking on the delivery itself to be enough. Rise of the Skywalker isn't an ending, a sequel, a reboot, or a remix.

""Birdman"" for the tech sector. An enthralling performance by Michael Fassbender fuels this brilliant, infuriating and richly unconventional take on the life of an American visionary. There's undeniable craftsmanship here, especially in Fassbender's confident and transformative performance, but Sorkin's script fails to shout and quip its way to anything approaching dramatic vibrancy.

It's a high wire act that might leave some feeling left behind. Somehow, though, Boyle pulls it off not by backing off the speechifying but by leaning into it and allowing it to sing. Racing in high gear from start to finish, Danny Boyle's electric direction temperamentally complements Sorkin's highly theatrical three-act study, which might one day be fascinating to experience in a staged setting.

It's a cliché to say that Apple changed the world, but how and why did that happen? ""Steve Jobs"" is robust and entertaining, but the answer it provides is incomplete. Steve Jobs is an exciting piece of iconoclasm: a talky, charged thriller for the brain that offers an intimate interpretation of who Jobs really was, even as it shrewdly undercuts many of the high-tech-saviour claims that have been made for him.

Steve Jobs is an exciting piece of iconoclasm: a talky, charged thriller for the brain that offers an intimate interpretation of who Jobs really was, even as it shrewdly undercuts many of the high-tech-saviour claims that have been made for him. Steve Jobs is a fascinating study of a man, explaining who he was but never making a judgment about who he is. The movie lets audiences compute that for themselves. A whirlwind tour through the computer age with a flawed human at its center. In many ways the film reflects its hero's brilliance. It's a scintillating construction, though one that sometimes feels like a product launch in its own right. What's most difficult about Sorkin's intricate fantasy is not acknowledging Jobs' darkness, but setting aside all hope of seeing the real man who inspired it. Sorkin's long-held faith in the abilities of great men to lead humanity forward is transmuted by his lack of affinity for technology into something with more perspective and plangency. This is simultaneously Sorkin's most satisfying movie script and Boyle's most graceful work as a director. The tension between Boyle's restless energy and Sorkin's tendency to run in place drives the movie. Feels like a series of beautifully and meticulously crafted tiles in a half-finished mosaic; you can admire the pieces but still come away feeling like you've been deprived of the whole. Steve Jobs and all of the characters around him fail to come to life in any absorbing fashion. They're not real people; they're all hashtags. Can you be a nice guy, and a great man? Steve Jobs is the case in point, and ""Steve Jobs"" says no. A smart, hugely entertaining film that all but bristles with crackling creative energy. The energy is relentless and the actors all more than meet the challenge of not only keeping up with Sorkin's trademark, rat-a-tat patter but also making it sing. Written, directed and acted to perfection, and so fresh and startling in conception and execution that it leaves you awed. Fassbender rips through the role of the volcanic Jobs. Is he really that good? Hell, yeah. It is a formally audacious, intellectually energized entertainment, a powerful challenge to the lazy conventions of Hollywood storytelling and a feast for connoisseurs of contemporary screen acting.

Capably shot, well acted (notwithstanding Kate Winslet's shape-shifting accent), its score propulsive, if a little too insistent, it's a finely crafted piece of work. But as a film, I found it nearly insufferable. The film feels so electric while you're watching, it's hard to believe that after two hours, it doesn't even get to the iPod, let alone the iPhone. As scathingly played by Fassbender, Jobs looks almost as sleek and perfected as one of his computers. Fassbender looks enough like Jobs that it's not distracting, and he finds a voice for the character. It's all too neatly staged to make for dynamic cinema, even if the dialogue does crackle with a delicious nastiness.

Michael Fassbender will be in every best actor conversation from now until Oscar night (and deservedly so) for his mesmerizing turn as the legendary and legendarily difficult visionary Jobs. Boyle films the proceedings on a slightly grainy stock that gives the movie just the hint of a documentary. There's propulsion and energy. He takes Sorkin's script and pumps it with amphetamines. Is ""Steve Jobs"" the final say on Steve Jobs? That's hard to say. But like its subject, it should remain relevant for years to come.

By matching Sorkin's words with Boyle's style and Fassbender's talent, Steve Jobs has hit the trifecta. Sorkin and his word-winging are the point here: the walk-and-talks and occasional flashbacks aside, director Danny Boyle has a highly structured backstage play on his hands, and it doesn't give him much room to move. The Full Sorkin Treatment has electrified a well-trod subject. But it also smothers it in artifice. What raises Steve Jobs way above the level of most biopics is the totality of Fassbender's immersion into the character. It rings emotionally and dramatically false, too at variance with the actual outsized talents and flaws of this man as they've been obsessively catalogued elsewhere. The acting is superb, no easy feat when trying to recite Sorkin's words while walking down seemingly endless hallways. Fassbender doesn't look a thing like Jobs and it doesn't matter a bit. As the title character, Michael Fassbender gets the SOB part down just fine, but there's little evidence of the personal magnetism that enabled Jobs to bend so many people to his will. Steve Jobs the man was complicated - and often infuriating to family, friends and colleagues at Apple Inc., the computer company he co-founded. Steve Jobs the film is also complicated -- and consistently thrilling. With such a tetchy, self-absorbed control freak at its center, it's difficult to explain just why ""Steve Jobs"" is as entertaining, even pleasurable, as it is.

Still, Steve Jobs doesn't dig much beyond the surface of the man in the title.

Thanks to Fassbender's revelatory performance, Jobs comes across as a captivating monster, a dictator in a black turtleneck who is impossible to ignore. It entertains and enlightens, and it's bang on in showing how great ideas are born not through compromise but through vision and determination. The acting is unarguably, uniformly strong.

""Stoker,"" his first American-set, English language picture, is no exception. A bizarrely perverse, beautifully rendered mystery that you may or may not care to solve. It may be Mr. Park's reputation that induces a state of queasy anticipation in the early scenes of ""Stoker."" But it is also, unquestionably, his craft. Spontaneity has been banished by rigid stylization, and the net effect is as lifeless as a severed head that turns up in a basement freezer. Just because something is unsettling doesn't make it involving. Stoker's ultimate wispiness makes Park's achievement all the more impressive: He's the magician pulling a deft sleight of hand, waiting until the very last moment to reveal that all is illusion. The film plays like a Brian De Palma homage to Hitchcock - albeit one loaded with Park's symbol-laden visuals. The film has visual style to spare, but even that becomes overwhelming, turning Stoker into self-parody. Beneath all the silk and powder, it transpires that Stoker is actually nothing more than a schlocky, screeching B-movie; an animated skeleton sent up to spook us. It's at its most entertaining when it shakes off its clothes. Straight-to-download is the deserved fate. Don't hold it back by buying a ticket. Full of heavingly gorgeous images that envelop a viewer before smothering them, its maddening elements eventually become too much to bear. Park has built a hothouse of erotic tension that's primed to explode. Some will find it too much. Screw them. Park's goal is to bust form, not conform to it. Take Stoker for what it is: a thriller of savage beauty. The performances are excellent, but it's the direction that lifts the movie up and spins it around. This erotic psychodrama rivals his Oldboy and Lady Vengeance in its bold color and delirious compositions but avoids the ritualized sadism that made those films such dubious pleasures. There is no mystery in Stoker, only ''style,'' and a stultifying sense that the world's been rigged with evil. Park's film is head-spinningly kinky stuff, even by Korean standards, and the fact it has somehow emerged from the American studio system in all its unhinged glory is itself a marvel. All talk and no trousers. Figuratively speaking. As it becomes more and more delirious in its explanations of Charlie's past, ""Stoker"" at least gives you a few images to remember ... It's best taken one tense, exhilarating moment at a time, without anticipation or expectation. What sets ""Stoker"" apart are the exquisitely grotesque bursts of death, which usually occur only after an effectively maddening series of tension-building scenes.

The problem is that real emotion is lacking and the net result is curiously opaque. Talent behind the camera, talent in front, and yet nothing worth watching. What happened?

If you're like me, you'll forgive its more melodramatic clichés and just surrender to its raw, brass-knuckle force. But as a depiction of a time and place, Straight Outta Compton  - from its low-rider Chevys on hydraulics blaring hip-hop to police battering ram vehicles crashing into suspected crack houses - nails it. One of the summer's most entertaining and provocative movies ... ""Straight Outta Compton"" goes right to the heart of what made N.W.A. one of the most defiant groups of all time. The casting in Straight Outta Compton is universally pitch perfect, including brief cameos by Keith Stanfield as Snoop and Marcc Rose as Tupac that are fantastically spot on. The sheer force of Straight Outta Compton steamrolls its flaws. Director Gray, who is from Compton and made a name for himself directing some of hip-hop's best music videos, has given us a movie that feels honest and urgent. It's clear what producers Ice Cube and Dr. Dre are most interested in: the money. Vibrant, rambunctious, and as lopsided as a cake taken out of the oven too soon. There's a grittier, grimier story in here, but it needed a different script and probably a different director than the uncritical F. Gary Gray, whose resume is studded with old-school rap videos and Ice Cube projects. If you're not a fan of N.W.A, you'll still find much to enjoy here. If you are a fan, you'll love this movie as much as I did. But as a depiction of a time and place, Straight Outta Compton  - from its low-rider Chevys on hydraulics blaring hip-hop to police battering ram vehicles crashing into suspected crack houses - nails it. One of the summer's most entertaining and provocative movies ... ""Straight Outta Compton"" goes right to the heart of what made N.W.A. one of the most defiant groups of all time. The casting in Straight Outta Compton is universally pitch perfect, including brief cameos by Keith Stanfield as Snoop and Marcc Rose as Tupac that are fantastically spot on. The sheer force of Straight Outta Compton steamrolls its flaws. Director Gray, who is from Compton and made a name for himself directing some of hip-hop's best music videos, has given us a movie that feels honest and urgent. It's clear what producers Ice Cube and Dr. Dre are most interested in: the money. Vibrant, rambunctious, and as lopsided as a cake taken out of the oven too soon. There's a grittier, grimier story in here, but it needed a different script and probably a different director than the uncritical F. Gary Gray, whose resume is studded with old-school rap videos and Ice Cube projects. If you're not a fan of N.W.A, you'll still find much to enjoy here. If you are a fan, you'll love this movie as much as I did. A sprawling, overstuffed, formulaic but highly entertaining story of pop stardom and its discontents in which the pioneers of gangsta rap are burnished to a high mythological gloss. Director F. Gary Gray has too big a story to tell, enough for a TV miniseries (or a season's worth of Behind the Music episodes), and you can see him straining to cram everything in even as the film stretches to the two-and-a-half hour mark. Brashly winning and unapologetically self-serving. There's some grit at the get-go, and some thrill at witnessing the development of a musical form. But the drama slows down once the money starts rolling in and the rappers' chief antagonists become each other, and maybe their manager. ""Straight Outta Compton"" ends up juggling more story lines and moods than it can handle. Like its subjects, the iconic late rap conglomerate N.W.A., F. Gary Gray's ""Straight Outta Compton"" starts out strong, peaks quickly, and then gets tangled in complications and compromise and falls apart. If any film should be forgiven its excesses, it's Straight Outta Compton, which is about the clashes and camaraderie among men whose unruliness sparked a cultural moment that was beyond their ability-and their willingness-to contain. An explosively entertaining biopic about the hip-hop group that brought gangsta rap into the mainstream of popular culture in the 1980s. Straight Outta Compton makes that same thudding power echo in the thrill of a fresh track and the first rhymes from five young men who changed the music landscape nearly 30 years ago. F. Gary Gray's excellent film is as sympathetic as it is bombastic, even when it depicts some of the rough stuff, a lot of the stupid excesses that come with fame, and even some quasi-criminal activities. There's way too much inside-baseball money talk here, when a simpler plot -- one about a band whose apocalyptic vision comes to pass -- would have been plenty. Straight Outta Compton manages to keep its sharp teeth despite its adherence to form. The movie doesn't neuter N.W.A.'s story so much as mold it to a familiar model. In the small pool of big-budget hip-hop biopics, ""Straight Outta Compton"" is near the top. The group members' stories are overly familiar to rap fans, as are portrayals of the big bad music industry in general, but that doesn't take away from the film's dramatic tension. This movie burns so hot that it's bound to run out of steam. It does. But what stands is an amazement, an electrifying piece of hip-hop history that speaks urgently to right now. It's a story driven by classic tensions: struggle and triumph, division and conquest, group and individual. As enlightening as it is entertaining, as sobering as it is exhilarating, ""Straight Outta Compton"" reminds viewers not only who N.W.A. were and what they meant, but also why they mattered - and still do. Jackson Jr. artfully evokes Ice Cube's tough-guy charisma. Mitchell's Eazy emerges as the film's most complicated figure, throwing his lot in with a manager who may not have his best interests at heart. Policemen, journalists who dislike rap and Suge Knight will find little to enjoy in this movie - all are portrayed as villains with zero subtlety. But the film as a whole is critical of its heroes' mistakes. Despite Straight Outta Compton's energetic acting and Gray's capture of in-studio Eureka! moments, it never manages to transcend biopic hagiography ... There's little to distinguish the movie from any number of overlong hit-by-hit music biopics of the nodding-approvingly-from-behind-a-mixing-console variety. ""Straight Outta Compton,"" F. Gary Gray's biopic of pioneering gangsta rappers N.W.A., manages to feel urgent and alive, even as it plays like the coolest episode of VH1's ""Behind the Music"" ever.

The year's most muddled piece of storytelling. Even the idea of nihilist camaraderie, which should come naturally with the Peckinpah-by-way-of-post-Crisis-DC premise, feels like a load of hooey; the characters are often too busy posing to exchange more than a few words at a time. David Ayer's flash-and-dash directing style makes it a challenge to follow the story, not to mention a chore to process the onslaught of violence. The weaker characters and generally weak plot keep it from being one of the better comic book movies. In a year overloaded with comic-book movies, ""Suicide Squad"" just seems like more of the same. On paper, this could have been the antidote to an increasingly codified strain of comic-book movies, but in the end, it's just another high-attitude version of the same. A gleefully nihilistic, abysmally messy romp that delights in upending the genre's conventions and tries desperately to, like, totally blow your mind with its outre freak show. Who stole the soul of Suicide Squad? I'd say it's Ayer's willingness to go all limp-dick and compromise his hardcore action bona fides for a PG-13 crowdpleaser that would rather ingratiate than cut deep, or even cut at all. What a waste of a perfectly twisted Suicide Squad. It's probably best to think of ""Suicide Squad"" as a primer, an entry into a side world of the DC Universe that may pay bigger benefits in later films. With Jared Leto playing Joker, the promise was of a return to the kind of storytelling found in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. Sadly, that doesn't prove to be the case at all. So much happens in David Ayer's DC Comics adaptation Suicide Squad that by the end, it's as if you've seen nothing. Harley Quinn is an embodiment of all the conflicting things this frankly disastrous new movie, choppily written and directed David Ayer, is attempting to do.

It's a clotted and delirious film, with flashes of preposterous, operatic silliness. Occasionally, the film feels like Ayer is trying to fight his way out from underneath an enormous, suffocating parachute. It's not satisfying storytelling; the flashbacks roll in and out, explaining either too much or too little, and the action may be violent but it's not interesting. Suicide Squad is the rare superhero movie in which I actually found myself wondering about the characters' inner lives.

He has done just that, with a singular vision, an unbridled passion and a creative vengeance that is so bold and so bad (in a colourfully good way) that it leaves viewers breathless.

If awards were handed out for the loudest movie of the year, Suicide Squad would be Schindler's List. But volume is not vision...while containing some entertaining performances, [it] turns out to be just another generic superhero action movie.

Suicide Squad does have quite a few tremendously entertaining sequences of high action and low comedy. It's a shame it never rises beyond that.

Everyone started making a movie before they really knew what they were doing. You need adults in charge, and there are no adults in charge here. The result is, yet again, a total sh-tshow. If you know someone you really can't stand - not someone you dislike, not someone who rubs you the wrong way, but someone you really loathe and detest - send that person a ticket for ""Suicide Squad."" ""Suicide Squad"" is a so-so, off-peak superhero movie. It chases after the nihilistic swagger of ""Deadpool"" and the anarchic whimsy of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" but trips over its own feet. [A] bloated and cheerless monstrosity. Ayer tries to bring his trademark realism to the action sequences, but it gets lost in the realm of comic-book fantasy. It's massive, messy and noisy. And it stinks. [It was up to Ayer] to revitalize...the DC franchise. He has done just that, with a singular vision, an unbridled passion and a creative vengeance that is so bold and so bad (in a colourfully good way) that it leaves viewers breathless. ""Suicide Squad"" is a concept in search of a story worth telling. Wildly tonally inconsistent, not to mention cluttered and poorly paced. If awards were handed out for the loudest movie of the year, Suicide Squad would be Schindler's List. But volume is not vision...while containing some entertaining performances, [it] turns out to be just another generic superhero action movie.

Everything about ""Suicide Squad"" from the title on down promises overkill. And the movie, to its ultimate discredit, delivers. Suicide Squad looked bright and promising in its run-up, but lands on the screen with a big-budget thud of missed opportunities. ""Suicide Squad"" is an interminable muddle. For all that exposition, the film never tells us what we really need to know: Why should we care? It was supposed to show us that the folks at Warner Bros. still know how to make great comic book movies. Suicide Squad is not very successful at that. In aiming for - but falling short of appealing to - the teenage demographic, the film is a double cop-out, disappointing both fans of the source material's grown-up gloom-and-doom aesthetic and discerning adolescents. Sure, it's terrible. But it's not even close to the worst movie of the summer or the year. Sometimes it's good to be bad. In Suicide Squad's case, bad is just plain bad. It gives villainy a bad name.

Sully is so square, it's a wonder it even gets airborne. An unabashed crowdpleaser about a hero fighting to maintain that title when corporate greed threatens to tarnish his image. It's an effectively thrilling story of quietly unassuming, can-do American heroism-the kind, sadly, we don't get to witness much these days.

Listen up, Oscar. Hanks and director Eastwood deserve the three words Sully prizes most: Job well done. The event itself remains a stunner, but Clint Eastwood's somewhat drab drama sheds no new light on the media-shy pilot.

Clint Eastwood still has surprises in him. Sully can feel like a dutiful, hagiographic slog, even though its actual running time barely tops 90 minutes and both Hanks and Eckhart give warm, understated, funny performances in the only two roles developed enough to qualify as real characters Hanks's Sullenberger is by far Eastwood's most untarnished standard-bearer to date. Not even Nelson Mandela came off looking this good. Hanks is very good at playing an Everyman, and Eastwood is content to showcase Sullenberger in that way.

A porterhouse of a movie that touches your heart. Hanks does an admirable job of showing Sully's humiliating stress while his reputation was being challenged, with the first-rate support of a cast that includes Laura Linney as his wife, and Jamey Sheridan and Anna Gunn as his surly inquisitors. Thrilling when we're on and around the plane (seeing that giant CGI bird splash down, especially on an Imax screen, makes you realize how improbable the whole enterprise was) and too often thudding when we're not.

Abrams' imitation is a shade too reverent for my taste. He lacks the subversive edge that allowed Joe Dante to bite his producer's hand and bring Gremlins to life, for example, and Abrams seems unsure just how scary he wants things to get. Abrams fashions Super 8 in such a calculating manner, with every element weighed both for maximum nostalgia value and ironic hipster cred, that it has an artificial feel to it. It's like a birthday cake made of spun glass. This sci-fi thriller has an engrossing plot and a strong cast of fully drawn characters. There's even a sweet youthful love story. In other words, it's a summer blockbuster firing on all cylinders. The result is a sci-fi monster movie that keeps its sense of fun and humanity. It's a valentine to a classically American genre -- the B-movie -- and a nostalgic look back on a more innocent time. This new film isn't perfect, and may not be a world-changer, but it's certainly a world-pleaser. It's the child actors, heroic indeed, who rescue Super 8 from the blockbuster grip of its adult makers. For pretty much the first half of the new movie from writer-director J.J. Abrams, Super 8 isn't really even an alien thriller; it's a sad-sweet tale of loss and coming-of-age set in the golden-gone days of the late '70s. The worst that can be said about the film is that the characters are far more compelling than the mystery they solve. Its pleasures are borrowed, but durable. Attempts the difficult feat of balancing self-consciousness about the olden days with wide-eyed, headlong, present-tense fun. For about an hour it succeeds marvelously. The modest letdown that follows exposes the limitations of Mr. Abrams's imagination. Has moments of greatness, but the ending is a slight disappointment. Breathing new life into these old forms is a next-to-impossible mission, but if the skeletons in your closet are made of celluloid, ""Super 8"" will be more of a treat than a trick. Writer-director J.J. Abrams overloads this sci-fi adventure with so many homages to his co-producer Steven Spielberg that it plays like the elder director's greatest hits, - his characteristic scares and sense of wonder. A retro monster mash with a child's heart, a prodigy's unstoppable imagination and FX dazzle to spare. A strong Kyle Chandler enforces order as Joe's lawman dad, while Elle Fanning catapults from child star to romantic heroine as a troubled teen. ""Super 8"" knows what it wants to be, but like the earnest super-8 amateur flick its young heroes labor over, the movie skips some steps to achieve an effect. The result is an almost-great valentine to Gen-X genre milestones. There is a lot to like about Super 8, but little that's new. ""Super 8'' is a curious thing indeed: A good movie that makes you want to go home and re-watch a great one. All too often the plot feels calculated rather than organic, the result of a time-tested formula rather than genuine innovation. It's as full of rich characters as it is smart popcorn-movie scares. This melding of two cinematic sensibilities, though effective at moments, is finally not as exciting or involving as it we'd like it to be.

Put ""The Goonies,"" ""E.T.,"" ""Close Encounters"" and ""War of the Worlds"" in that blender from ""Gremlins"" -- and transport the mixture back to 1979 in the ""Back to the Future"" DeLorean -- and you get J.J. Abrams' ""Super 8."" Abrams and executive producer Steven Spielberg are reprising a few of their own greatest hits, and creating the kind of Saturday-matinee adventure that kids of a bygone era would have raced to the neighborhood movie house to see. If you're wondering what's missing from so many big-budget, effects-driven Hollywood movies, the answer lies in J.J. Abrams' Super 8: heart and passion. What's happening onscreen really matters to... A love letter to a cinematic era, before 'blockbuster' became a synonym for 'franchise' or 'tent pole.' Remember the good old days? This is the movie you went to see on a Saturday afternoon in the good old days. There's much to like in this story of a group of young movie-makers who stumble upon an event right out of, well, the movies. If Abrams had stuck with the kids and cut way back on all the sci-fi hoo-ha, his film might have stood a fighting chance of being charming. Big is not always better, even when it comes to fantasies. Abrams remembers the simple rule that a majority of his contemporaries have forgotten: action and mayhem have meaning only when an audience cares about the people trapped within the maelstrom. Abrams is a loving synthesist of Spielberg's themes and techniques, a worthy inheritor of his beagle-like narrative instincts ... but when it comes to the plucking of heartstrings, he lacks the true Stradivarian shamelessness of his mentor. This may not be a children's classic that will last for generations, but it will make for a rollicking afternoon at the multiplex for kids around Joe's age.

Regrettably, writer/director JJ Abrams (Star Trek, Mission Impossible III, co-creator of TV series Lost) is better here at building suspense than paying it off.

Super 8 is the sweetest film of 2011, an affectionate shout-out to amateurs everywhere. It is thrilling, fatuous, pyrotechnical, whimsical, barnstorming, batty, out there, out to lunch and finally, though it flails exuberantly to the last frame, out of ideas. Wears off like a warm childhood memory. The geekery has charm, but is a little self-conscious and just occasionally, this movie resembles an open-ended, rambling drama serial that gets a little, well, lost.

Super 8 is the most intensely Spielbergian film you'll ever see that Steven Spielberg didn't actually direct himself. And it's early Spielberg! What keeps us enthralled is its nostalgic sensibility, partly for the time but mostly for its old-school film-making values.
